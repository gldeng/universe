## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Separation Axiom)**

The primitive separation operation $`\text{SEP}`$ transforms primitive binary states $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$ into independently observable separated states:

$`\text{SEP}: \mathcal{D}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{S}_{1.5} = \{\alpha|, |\beta\}`$

where $`\alpha|`$ represents the left-side state, $`|\beta`$ represents the right-side state, and $`|`$ is the separation marker.

**Axiom 2 (State-Internal Separation Axiom)**

The separation operation has intrinsic properties, allowing it to act on multiple states simultaneously:

$`\text{SEP}(\alpha, \beta) = (\alpha|, |\beta) \neq \text{SEP}(\alpha) \cup \text{SEP}(\beta)`$

This indicates that the separation operation is not equivalent to the separation of individual states, but rather a transformation of the entire relationship.

**Axiom 3 (Separation Preservation Axiom)**

Separated states maintain the basic relationships of the original states but gain independence:

$`\text{ID}(\alpha|) = \text{ID}(\alpha)`$, $`\text{ID}(|\beta) = \text{ID}(\beta)`$

$`\text{REL}(\alpha|, |\beta) = \text{REL}(\alpha, \beta)`$ 

where $`\text{ID}`$ represents the identity function of a state, and $`\text{REL}`$ represents the relationship function between states.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Separation

The essence of primitive separation is to transform the simple oppositional structure of primitive binary states into a more complex relationship system with spatial independence. Separation states can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{S}_{1.5} = \{\alpha|, |\beta\} = \{P_L(\mathcal{D}_1), P_R(\mathcal{D}_1)\}`$

where $`P_L`$ and $`P_R`$ are the left and right projection operations, projecting the primitive binary states onto independent spaces after separation.

Separation states create the first state with spatial structure, laying the foundation for subsequent spatial dimensions and composite state systems. At the same time, they preserve the information of the primitive binary states while adding new structural information.

Separation states exist at dimension 1.5 because they transcend simple binary opposition (dimension 1) but have not yet reached the composite state systems capable of fully independent state combinations (dimension 2).

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Separation States

Separation state systems have the following basic properties:

1. **Spatial Independence**: Separation states allow two primitive states to exist independently in different "locations":
   $`\text{LOC}(\alpha|) \neq \text{LOC}(|\beta)`$, where $`\text{LOC}`$ is the location function

2. **Relationship Preservation**: Separation does not change the basic relationships between states:
   $`\text{REL}(\alpha|, |\beta) = \text{REL}(\alpha, \beta)`$

3. **Semi-Compositionality**: Separation states support limited composition but not completely free combination:
   $`\{\alpha|, |\beta\} \neq \{\alpha|, |\alpha\} \neq \{\beta|, |\beta\}`$, but $`\{\alpha|, |\alpha, \beta|, |\beta\}`$ does not exist

4. **Separation Stability**: Once separation is formed, states maintain their separated status:
   $`\text{SEP}^{n}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \text{SEP}(\mathcal{D}_1), \forall n > 0`$

5. **Asymmetry**: The separation operation introduces directionality:
   $`\alpha| \neq |\alpha`$, $`\beta| \neq |\beta`$

### 1.4 Separation Evolution Rules

The evolution of separation state systems follows extended alternation rules:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{S}_{1.5}}: (\alpha|, |\beta)^t \mapsto (|\beta, \alpha|)^{t+1} \mapsto (\beta|, |\alpha)^{t+2} \mapsto (|\alpha, \beta|)^{t+3} \mapsto (\alpha|, |\beta)^{t+4}`$

This indicates that separation states not only alternate in state but also in position during their evolution, forming a cycle with period 4, which is an extension of the period 2 cycle of primitive binary states.

The state sequence of the system forms a more complex pattern than primitive binary states:

$`(\alpha|, |\beta) \rightarrow (|\beta, \alpha|) \rightarrow (\beta|, |\alpha) \rightarrow (|\alpha, \beta|) \rightarrow (\alpha|, |\beta) \rightarrow \cdots`$

This evolution pattern introduces the first genuine spatial relationship transformation and serves as the foundation for all subsequent spatial operations.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Separation States

The following properties can be directly derived from the separation state axiom system:

1. **Extended State Space**: The state space dimension of separation states is 1.5, intermediate between binary states and four-element composite states:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 1.5 = \log_2 |\mathcal{S}_{1.5}| + 0.5 = \log_2 2 + 0.5`$
   
   The additional 0.5 dimension comes from spatial position information

2. **Extended Transformation Group**: The system supports a four-order cyclic group of transformations:
   $`G_{\mathcal{S}_{1.5}} = \{I, R, F, FR\} \cong Z_4`$
   
   where $`I`$ is the identity transformation, $`R`$ is the position exchange transformation, $`F`$ is the state flip transformation, and $`FR`$ is the combination of state flip and position exchange

3. **Extended Conservation Laws**: The system has richer conserved quantities:
   
   - Total number of states: $`|\mathcal{S}_{1.5}| = 2`$
   - Total number of positions: $`|\text{LOC}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5})| = 2`$
   - Separation measure: $`\text{SEP-M}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = \sum_i |\text{LOC}(s_i) - \text{LOC}(s_j)| = \text{const}`$

4. **Extended Ergodicity**: The system traverses the extended state space during evolution:
   $`\{s^t, s^{t+1}, s^{t+2}, s^{t+3}, ...\} = \mathcal{S}_{1.5}^{*}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{S}_{1.5}^{*}`$ is all possible arrangements of separation states

### 2.2 Information Properties of Separation States

Separation state systems have the following characteristics from an information theory perspective:

1. **Information Capacity Extension**: The total information capacity of the system is 1.5 bits:
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) + \mathcal{C}(\text{LOC}) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ bit}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{C}(\text{LOC}) = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$ represents position information

2. **Information Form Separation**: The information in the system is divided into two types:
   
   - State information: $`I_{\text{state}}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 1 \text{ bit}`$
   - Position information: $`I_{\text{loc}}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$

3. **Conditional Entropy Properties**: There exists a conditional relationship between state and position:
   $`H(\text{state}|\text{loc}) < H(\text{state})`$
   
   indicating that knowing the position can reduce uncertainty about the state

4. **Information Redundancy Emergence**: The system begins to exhibit the first information redundancy:
   $`R(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = I(\text{state};\text{loc}) > 0`$
   
   indicating that state information and position information are correlated, not completely independent

### 2.3 Symmetries of Separation Systems

Separation state systems exhibit the following symmetry features:

1. **Position Symmetry**: The system has symmetry under left-right position exchange:
   $`R: (\alpha|, |\beta) \mapsto (|\beta, \alpha|)`$
   
   This is the first genuine spatial symmetry

2. **State Symmetry**: The system maintains its structure unchanged under state exchange:
   $`F: (\alpha|, |\beta) \mapsto (\beta|, |\alpha)`$
   
   This is inherited from the primitive binary state system

3. **Time Translation Symmetry**: The system repeats after a time translation of 4 units:
   $`\mathcal{T}^4: s^t \mapsto s^{t+4} = s^t`$

4. **Time Reversal Symmetry**: The system exhibits special symmetry under time reversal operations:
   $`\mathcal{TR}(s^t) = s^{-t} = s^{4-t \mod 4}`$
   
   indicating that forward and backward time evolution paths are different but both form closed loops

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Binary States to Separation States

Binary state systems evolve into separation state systems through the separation operation, representing an important dimensional transition:

1. **Dimensional Extension Mechanism**:
   $`\mathcal{D}_1 \xrightarrow{\text{SEP}} \mathcal{S}_{1.5}`$
   
   $`\dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \xrightarrow{\text{+0.5}} \dim(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 1.5`$
   
   The separation operation adds 0.5 dimensions of spatial structural information to the system

2. **State Representation Extension**:
   $`\{\alpha, \beta\} \xrightarrow{\text{SEP}} \{\alpha|, |\beta\}`$
   
   Original identifiers acquire position markers

3. **Evolution Period Extension**:
   $`\text{Period}(\mathcal{D}_1) = 2 \xrightarrow{\text{×2}} \text{Period}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 4`$
   
   System periodicity doubles

4. **Transformation Group Extension**:
   $`G_{\mathcal{D}_1} = Z_2 \xrightarrow{\text{×2}} G_{\mathcal{S}_{1.5}} = Z_4`$
   
   The number of transformations supported by the system doubles

### 3.2 Relationship Between Separation States and XOR

Separation states are an important precursor theory to XOR operations:

1. **Pre-XOR Properties**:
   Separation states provide necessary prerequisites for XOR operations:
   $`\text{SEP}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \{\alpha|, |\beta\} \xrightarrow{\text{composition}} \{\alpha| \otimes |\beta\} \approx \{\alpha \oplus \beta\}`$
   
   where $`\otimes`$ represents the composition operation between separation states, which can approximate XOR

2. **State Separation Introduction**:
   Separation states introduce the first independence of observational perspectives:
   $`\text{View}(\alpha|, |\beta) = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$
   but $`\text{View}(\alpha| \otimes |\beta) \neq \{\alpha, \beta\} \approx \{\alpha \oplus \beta\}`$
   
   This makes special combinations like XOR possible

3. **Composite Operation Foundation**:
   Separation states provide the basic structure for composite operations:
   $`\text{COMP} = \text{SEP} + \text{JOIN} \approx \text{XOR}`$
   
   where $`\text{JOIN}`$ is the combination operation of separation states

4. **Information Transformation Foundation**:
   Separation states provide a foundation for non-simple information transformation:
   $`I(a| \otimes |b) \neq I(a|) + I(|b)`$
   
   This is the precursor to XOR information processing characteristics

### 3.3 Applications of Separation States in Higher Dimensions

The concept of separation states continues to play a role in higher-dimensional theories:

1. **Spatial Structure Foundation**:
   Separation states provide a foundation for spatial dimension theory:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{1.5} \xrightarrow{\text{extension}} \mathcal{S}_3 = \{\omega_{xyz} | x,y,z \in \{0,1\}\}`$
   
   where $`\omega_{xyz}`$ is a point in three-dimensional space

2. **Information Isolation Techniques**:
   Information isolation introduced by separation states is crucial in quantum information:
   $`SEP(|\psi\rangle) = |\psi_A\rangle \otimes |\psi_B\rangle`$
   
   This is the foundation for understanding quantum entanglement

3. **Spacetime Topology Foundation**:
   Separation states introduce the first topological relationships:
   $`\text{Topo}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = \{L, R, L \to R, R \to L\}`$
   
   This provides the foundation for subsequent spacetime topology theories

4. **Causal Structure Foundation**:
   Separation operation is the foundation of causal network theory:
   $`\text{SEP}(C, E) = (C|, |E) \Rightarrow C \to E`$
   
   where $`C`$ is the cause and $`E`$ is the effect

## 4. Application and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

Primitive Separation Theory generates the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Fundamentality of Spatial Structure**:
   All spatial structures in nature should originate from basic separation mechanisms

2. **Information Spatial Localization**:
   Information has an intrinsic association with its position, but is not completely determined by it

3. **Pre-Causal Systems**:
   There should exist relationship systems intermediate between correlation and causation

4. **Four-Period Phenomena**:
   Many phenomena should exhibit spacetime symmetry patterns with period 4

### 4.2 Verification Methods

Primitive Separation Theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Logical Formalization**:
   Verify the formal consistency between separation logic and spacetime logic

2. **Physical Mapping**:
   Study the spatial separation of particles and the concept of locality in quantum theory

3. **Computational Models**:
   Build computational models based on separation operations and verify their differences from traditional Boolean operations

4. **Information Theory Verification**:
   Measure and verify the constraint effect of position information on state information

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Periodicity of Separation State System**

The separation state system $`\mathcal{S}_{1.5}`$ has a strict period-4 evolution pattern.

*Proof*:
According to the separation evolution rules, the state transitions are:

$`(\alpha|, |\beta)^t \mapsto (|\beta, \alpha|)^{t+1} \mapsto (\beta|, |\alpha)^{t+2} \mapsto (|\alpha, \beta|)^{t+3} \mapsto (\alpha|, |\beta)^{t+4}`$

It can be seen that the fourth state is identical to the initial state, i.e.:
$`s^{t+4} = s^t`$

For any other starting state, such as $`(|\beta, \alpha|)`$, a similar derivation would also yield a period-4 result.
Therefore, the system has a strict period-4 evolution pattern. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Gain of Separation States**

Separation state systems provide a 0.5-bit information gain compared to primitive binary state systems.

*Proof*:
The information capacity of the primitive binary state system is:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 |\mathcal{D}_1| = \log_2 2 = 1 \text{ bit}`$

The information capacity of the separation state system includes two parts:
1. State information: $`I_{\text{state}} = 1 \text{ bit}`$ (same as the primitive binary state)
2. Position information: $`I_{\text{loc}} = \log_2 2! / 2 = \log_2 1 = 0 \text{ bit}`$, but due to the combination of position and state, it actually provides $`0.5 \text{ bit}`$ of new information

Therefore, the total information capacity is:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \text{ bit}`$

The information gain is:
$`\Delta I = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) - \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$

This proves that separation states provide a 0.5-bit information gain compared to primitive binary states. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Dimensional Properties of Separation States**

The separation state system belongs to dimension 1.5 theory, positioned exactly between dimension 1 primitive binary theory and dimension 2 XOR theory.

*Proof*:
1. According to the dimension calculation formula, dimension depends on information capacity and structural complexity:
   $`D(\mathcal{T}) = \log_2 |\mathcal{T}| + \Delta C(\mathcal{T})`$

2. For binary states: $`D(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 2 + 0 = 1`$
   For XOR states: $`D(\text{XOR}) = \log_2 4 + 0 = 2`$

3. For separation states, the state space size is 2, but with additional structural complexity:
   $`D(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = \log_2 2 + 0.5 = 1.5`$
   
   where 0.5 comes from the additional structural information provided by the position dimension

4. Separation states are positioned exactly between two integer dimensions, having:
   - More information and structure than one-dimensional binary states (adding 0.5 dimension)
   - Less information and structure than two-dimensional XOR states (reducing 0.5 dimension)

Therefore, the correct dimensional property of the separation state system is 1.5. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Separation States and Cosmic Ontology**

Primitive Separation Theory is compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. The relationship between the SEP operation of separation states and these basic operations is:
   - SEP can be viewed as a semi-extension of FLIP: $`\text{SEP}(\alpha, \beta) = (\alpha|, |\beta) \approx \text{FLIP}_{\text{loc}}(\alpha, \beta)`$
   - SEP lays the foundation for XOR operations: $`\alpha \oplus \beta \approx \text{JOIN}(\alpha|, |\beta) = \alpha| \otimes |\beta`$
   - SEP is the precursor to the basic spatial mapping of SHIFT: $`\text{SHIFT}(\omega) \approx \text{SEP+JOIN}(\omega)`$

2. The recursive self-referential structure of Cosmic Ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   Separation states form a recursive relationship through $`\mathcal{S}_{1.5} = \text{SEP}(\mathcal{D}_1)`$ and $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \text{JOIN}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5})`$

3. The Binary Unity Axiom of Cosmic Ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   Corresponds to the binary separation $`\mathcal{S}_{1.5} = \{\alpha|, |\beta\}`$ of separation states, providing a precursor form of binary unity

4. The Dimensional Spectrum of Cosmic Ontology:
   Separation states occupy position 1.5 in the dimensional spectrum, perfecting the complete dimensional sequence from primitive states to composite states, filling the transition interval of dimensional leaps

Therefore, Primitive Separation Theory is an indispensable part of the complete system of Cosmic Ontology, filling the critical dimension 1.5 theoretical space and is fully compatible with the overall theoretical framework. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

Primitive Separation Theory is positioned as a dimension 1.5 theory in the theoretical spectrum of Cosmic Ontology for the following reasons:

1. **Information Capacity**: $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}_{1.5}) = 1.5 \text{ bit}`$, intermediate between the 1 bit of binary states and the 2 bits of XOR states

2. **Operational Complexity**: The system supports basic separation operations and limited composition operations, with complexity intermediate between FLIP operations and XOR operations
   - Dimension 1 theory (FLIP, binary states) supports only a single basic operation
   - Dimension 1.5 theory (separation states) supports basic operations and limited composition
   - Dimension 2 theory (XOR) supports fully free compositional operations

3. **Transformation Group Structure**: $`|G_{\mathcal{S}_{1.5}}| = 4 = 2^{1.5}`$ (approximate value), intermediate between the $`|G_{\mathcal{D}_1}| = 2`$ of binary states and the $`|G_{\text{XOR}}| = 8`$ of XOR

4. **Theory Dependency Relationship**: Primitive Point (0) → Primitive Duality (1) → Primitive Separation (1.5) → XOR (2), demonstrating a clear dimensional progression relationship, filling the theoretical leap from 1 to 2
