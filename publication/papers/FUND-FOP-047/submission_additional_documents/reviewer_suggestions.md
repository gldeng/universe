## Golden Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing Proportions

### Recommended Reviewers

1. **Frank Wilczek, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   - Email: wilczek@mit.edu
   - Expertise: Nobel Laureate in Physics with extensive work on fundamental constants and forces. His expertise in quantum field theory and the relations between mathematical structures and physical reality makes him well-suited to evaluate our information-theoretic approach to fundamental constants.

2. **Carlo Rovelli, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Aix-Marseille University
   - Email: rovelli@cpt.univ-mrs.fr
   - Expertise: Leading researcher in quantum gravity and foundations of physics. His work on relational quantum mechanics and information approaches to physics aligns with our paper's perspective on constants emerging from information structures.

3. **Doris Wörner, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: ETH Zurich
   - Email: doris.woerner@phys.ethz.ch
   - Expertise: Specialist in mathematical physics with focus on physical constants and dimensional analysis. Her research on the fine structure constant and its role in quantum electrodynamics is directly relevant to our paper.

4. **Sabine Hossenfelder, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies
   - Email: hossenfelder@fias.uni-frankfurt.de
   - Expertise: Theoretical physicist with work on the foundations of physics and philosophy of science. Her critical perspective on fundamental constants and the mathematical structure of physics would provide valuable scrutiny.

5. **Mark Tegmark, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   - Email: tegmark@mit.edu
   - Expertise: Cosmologist and physicist known for work on mathematical universe hypothesis. His research on the mathematical nature of reality parallels our approach to constants as emerging from information structures.

6. **Lee Smolin, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
   - Email: lsmolin@perimeterinstitute.ca
   - Expertise: Theoretical physicist working on quantum gravity and foundations of physics. His research on the nature of time and physical constants would provide valuable perspective on our approach.

### Reviewers to Exclude

1. **Roger Penrose, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: University of Oxford
   - Rationale: While Professor Penrose's work is highly respected, his published criticisms of information-based approaches to physical reality might prevent an unbiased evaluation of our information-theoretic framework.

2. **Brian Greene, Ph.D.**
   - Institution: Columbia University
   - Rationale: Professor Greene's strong commitment to string theory as an explanatory framework may conflict with our alternative approach to understanding fundamental constants.

### Additional Comments for Editor

The recommended reviewers represent a diverse range of expertise across theoretical physics, mathematical physics, quantum foundations, and philosophy of physics. We have suggested researchers who, while not directly involved in Universe Ontology development, have the necessary background to evaluate the mathematical rigor and physical significance of our proposed relationships between fundamental constants.

The reviewers we suggest excluding have published positions that may create a predisposition against our framework, potentially inhibiting fair evaluation of the specific mathematical relationships and their significance presented in this paper.
