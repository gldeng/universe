## Complete Description of Core Theory

### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into four core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $\Omega_C$ (space of definite reality), connected through an interface domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition states) and classical information (definite knowledge):

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical certainties), $I(\psi)$ is the total information content of state $\psi$, and $I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that execute quantum→classical transformations, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge), $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $K_C^\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization capacity and quantization capacity, while the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

$$\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}$$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within specific dimensions based on their capacity range.

### Quantum and Classical Domains

The fundamental characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized in the following points:

#### Core Properties of Quantum Domain

1. **Wavefunction Superposition** (Chaotic State): Systems exist simultaneously in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $$\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

2. **Quantum Entanglement** (Energy Form): Different parts form inseparable holistic connections
   $$\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: Correlations beyond space-time limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

#### Core Properties of Classical Domain

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information): Precisely measurable and describable definite states
   $$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty): Measure of system disorder and information loss
   $$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

3. **Locality and Certainty**: Finite propagation speed of interactions and measurement certainty
   $$P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)$$

### Multiple Dualism Hierarchies

Multiple Dualism Hierarchy Theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$$\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}$$

where:
- $\Omega_Q^{(i)}$ is the quantum domain of the i-th level (possibility space of that level)
- $\Omega_C^{(i)}$ is the classical domain of the i-th level (definite realization of that level)

The mapping functions between levels are defined as:

$$\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}$$

$$\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}$$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, creating infinitely recursive reality levels.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}$ between quantum and classical domains:

$$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q$$

satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: The transformation of a transformation equals identity
   $$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}$$
   $$\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}$$

2. **Information Preservation**: Information content is invariant before and after transformation
   $$I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))$$

3. **Uncertainty-Certainty Transformation**: Quantum uncertainty and classical certainty are mutually transformable
   $$U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k$$

where $U_Q$ is the measure of quantum uncertainty, $D_C$ is the measure of classical certainty, and $k$ is a universal constant.

## Core Branch Theories

### Detailed Quantum Domain Theory

The quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ is the possibility space in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Quantum Information Encoding

Quantum information is encoded through quantum states in complex Hilbert space:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1$$

where information density is quantified by von Neumann entropy:

$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln \lambda_i$$

#### 2. Quantum Dynamics

Quantum systems evolve following the Schrödinger equation, preserving information and energy conservation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial|\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle$$

Quantum system dynamics have three key characteristics:
- Superposition principle: States can simultaneously exist as linear combinations of multiple basis vectors
- Time reversibility: Under pure quantum evolution, systems can return to their initial state
- Phase coherence: Quantum systems maintain global phase relationships

#### 3. Quantum Entanglement Network

Quantum entanglement forms multi-particle entanglement networks, representable as:

$$|\Psi_{\text{network}}\rangle = \sum_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n} c_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} |i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n\rangle$$

Entanglement can be quantified through various means, including entanglement entropy:

$$E(|\psi_{AB}\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B)$$

Entanglement networks form non-local connection structures in the quantum domain, supporting super-classical information transmission.

#### 4. Quantum Fluctuations

The quantum domain has inherent quantum fluctuations, guaranteed by the uncertainty principle:

$$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

Quantum fluctuation intensity is related to system energy and temperature:

$$\langle(\Delta E)^2\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T}$$

These fluctuations are the source of creativity and possibility in the quantum domain.

### Detailed Classical Domain Theory

The classical domain $\Omega_C$ is the space of definite reality in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Classical Information Structure

Classical information exists in the form of definite states, representable through definite physical quantities:

$$K_C = \{(x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i, \ldots)_j\}$$

where $x_i$, $p_i$, etc. represent position, momentum, and other classical observables. Classical information entropy satisfies:

$$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

Key characteristics include information replicability and deletability, distinguishing it from quantum information.

#### 2. Deterministic Dynamics

Classical systems evolve following deterministic dynamical equations:

$$\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{v}(\vec{x},t), \quad \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)$$

The dynamics have three signature characteristics:
- Locality: Interactions propagate through local fields at finite speeds
- Causality: Present states are completely determined by the past
- Separability: Systems can be decomposed into independent subsystems

#### 3. Entropy Increase and Irreversibility

Irreversible processes in the classical domain lead to entropy increase:

$$\frac{dS_C}{dt} \geq 0$$

Systems tend toward maximum entropy states, guaranteed by the phase space volume expansion theorem:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\int_V d\Gamma = \int_V \sum_i \frac{\partial \dot{z}_i}{\partial z_i}d\Gamma$$

where $\{z_i\}$ is the set of phase space coordinates.

#### 4. Classical Knowledge Network

Classical knowledge forms causal networks, representable as directed graphs:

$$G_K = (V_K, E_K)$$

where $V_K$ is the set of knowledge nodes and $E_K$ is the set of causal relationships.

Knowledge coherence is measured by:

$$C(K_C) = \frac{1}{|V_K|} \sum_{i,j} \frac{|P_{ij}|}{d(i,j)}$$

where $P_{ij}$ is the set of effective paths connecting nodes $i$ and $j$, and $d(i,j)$ is the distance in the graph.

### Core Interface Theory

The interface $\mathcal{I}$ is the transition region between quantum and classical domains, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Interface Structure

The interface is the intersection of quantum and classical domains, defined as:

$$\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}$$

where $\mathcal{D}(x)$ is the decoherence measure function and $\mathcal{D}_c$ is the critical decoherence threshold.

Interface thickness is determined by the decoherence gradient:

$$\delta_{\mathcal{I}} = \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial x}\right|^{-1}$$

#### 2. Interface Dynamics

Interface position satisfies a nonlinear dynamical equation:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)$$

where:
- $\alpha$ is the diffusion coefficient
- $\beta$ is the bistable potential parameter
- $\mathcal{D}_0$ is the metastable threshold
- $\gamma\xi(x,t)$ is the quantum noise term

Interface oscillations have a characteristic frequency:

$$f_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}|\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}_0|$$

#### 3. Classicalization Process

The quantum→classical transition (classicalization) process is represented through the classicalization superoperator:

$$\mathcal{C}(\rho) = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i$$

where $P_i$ are projection operators. The classicalization process satisfies information conservation:

$$I(\rho) = I(\mathcal{C}(\rho)) + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

Classicalization efficiency is related to environmental and system parameters:

$$\eta_{\mathcal{C}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda\frac{E}{k_BT}}$$

where $E$ is system energy, $T$ is environmental temperature, and $\lambda$ is the coupling constant.

#### 4. Quantum-Classical Information Conversion

At the interface, information transitions from quantum to classical form:

$$I_Q \rightarrow I_C + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

Information matching in the conversion process is measured by:

$$M(I_Q, I_C) = \frac{I_C}{I_Q} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{hidden}}}{I_Q}$$

At the optimal interface, $M(I_Q, I_C)$ reaches a local maximum.

### Core Information Phase Transition Theory

Information phase transitions are key phenomena in the quantum-classical dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Basic Mechanism of Information Phase Transition

Information phase transition is a sudden change process experienced by information systems near certain critical parameter values, leading to qualitative changes in system information processing, structure, or function:

$$\Phi: \mathcal{S}(\lambda) \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'(\lambda+\delta\lambda)$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ is the information state of the system and $\lambda$ is the control parameter. Near the critical point $\lambda_c$, the order parameter behaves as:

$$\eta(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < \lambda_c \\
(\lambda - \lambda_c)^\beta, & \lambda \geq \lambda_c
\end{cases}$$

where $\beta$ is the critical exponent, characterizing the universality class of the phase transition.

#### 2. Types of Quantum-Classical Phase Transitions

Quantum-classical phase transitions can be categorized into several types, each with distinct characteristics:

- **First-order transitions**: Discontinuous changes in order parameters, with coexistence regions
- **Second-order transitions**: Continuous changes in order parameters but discontinuous derivatives, with diverging correlation lengths
- **Non-equilibrium transitions**: Far from equilibrium, with continuous energy or information flow
- **Topological transitions**: Changes in the overall topological properties of the system, with emergent edge states

The fluctuation correlation length near the critical point behaves as:

$$\xi(\lambda) \propto |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\nu}$$

where $\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent.

#### 3. Observer-Induced Phase Transitions

Observers can induce system phase transitions by adjusting parameters, including key parameters such as:

- **Observer dimension** $D_{\mathcal{O}}$: There exists a critical dimension $D_{\mathcal{O}}^c$ beyond which the system transitions from quantum to classical state
  
$$P(\text{quantum} \to \text{classical}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(D_{\mathcal{O}} - D_{\mathcal{O}}^c)}}$$

- **Observer resolution** $\eta_{\mathcal{O}}$: Affects the discriminatory ability of measurement bases
  
$$\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \begin{cases}
0, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} < \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
(\eta_{\mathcal{O}} - \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c)^\beta, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} \geq \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

- **Measurement frequency** $f_{\mathcal{O}}$: Related to the quantum Zeno effect
  
$$\tau_{\text{decoherence}} \propto \begin{cases}
(f_{\mathcal{O}}^c - f_{\mathcal{O}})^{-\nu}, & f_{\mathcal{O}} < f_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
0, & f_{\mathcal{O}} \geq f_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

#### 4. Multi-level Structure of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions exhibit nested hierarchical structures:

$$\mathcal{H} = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2, ..., \Phi_n\}$$

Phase transitions at different levels occur at specific scales and times:

$$L_i \approx L_0 \cdot e^{\alpha i}, \quad T_i \approx T_0 \cdot e^{\beta i}$$

Coupling between levels leads to cascade effects and fractal structures in phase transitions, with the Hausdorff dimension of the interface:

$$D_H = d - \frac{\beta}{\nu}$$

The observability of information phase transitions depends on the observation scale; they can only be detected when the observation window $L_{\text{obs}}$ is sufficiently large:

$$P_{\text{detection}} \sim 1 - e^{-(L_{\text{obs}}/\xi)^d}$$

### Core Observer Theory

Observers are nodes executing quantum→classical transitions, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Observer Structure

Observers consist of three core components:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}\}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific classicalization operator
- $\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific quantization operator
- $K_C^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base

Observer dimension is determined by their information processing capacity:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

#### 2. Dimensional Network Dynamics

Observer dimension satisfies a nonlinear dynamical equation:

$$\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})$$

where the last term represents the collective effect of the observer network.

Consensus formation in observer networks follows:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2$$

where $\omega_i$ are observer weights and $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$ is the average classicalization operator.

#### 3. Measurement Theory

In observer theory, the quantum measurement process can be represented as:

$$|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \otimes \rho_A \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{U_{\text{interaction}}} \sum_{i,j} c_i c_j^* |i\rangle\langle j| \otimes |A_i\rangle\langle A_j| \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_O} |i_0\rangle\langle i_0| \otimes |A_{i_0}\rangle\langle A_{i_0}| \otimes \rho_{O}^{i_0}$$

Measurement result probabilities are modulated by the observer resolution parameter $\eta_O$:

$$P(i_0||\psi\rangle) = |c_{i_0}|^2 \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_O|c_{i_0}|^2}}{\sum_j e^{\eta_O|c_j|^2}}$$

The observer energy resolution threshold relates to measurement resolution:

$$\eta_O = \frac{\hbar}{k_B T} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{\bar{E}_0}\right)$$

#### 4. Observer Hierarchical Network

Observers form multi-level network structures:

$$\mathcal{N} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}\}$$

where $\mathcal{O}^{(k)}$ is the set of k-th level observers and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of cross-level connections.

Higher-level observers perceive larger spatiotemporal scales:

$$L^{(k)} \approx L^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}, \quad T^{(k)} \approx T^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}$$

This explains why higher-dimensional observers can perceive larger-scale spatiotemporal patterns.
