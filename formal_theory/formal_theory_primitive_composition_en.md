## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Composition Axiom)**

The primitive composition system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ is constituted by combinations of basic binary states, existing in a two-dimensional state space:

$`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{ij} | i,j \in \{0,1\}\} \subset \mathcal{S}_2`$

where $`\mathcal{S}_2`$ is a two-dimensional state space, and $`\omega_{ij}`$ represents a composite state formed by the combination of basic binary states.

**Axiom 2 (Compositional Orthogonality Axiom)**

Composite states satisfy strict orthogonality relationships:

$`\langle \omega_{ij} | \omega_{kl} \rangle = \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl}`$

where $`\delta`$ is the Kronecker delta function, and $`\langle | \rangle`$ represents the inner product in the state space.

**Axiom 3 (Compositional Evolution Axiom)**

The evolution of the composite state system follows compositional rules and path preservation:

$`\omega_{ij}^t \mapsto \bigoplus_{k,l} c_{kl}^{ij} \omega_{kl}^{t+1}`$

where $`c_{kl}^{ij}`$ are state transition coefficients satisfying $`\sum_{k,l} |c_{kl}^{ij}|^2 = 1`$, and $`\bigoplus`$ represents the state composition operation.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Composition

The essence of primitive composition is the formation of higher complexity composite states through structured combination of basic binary states. The composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\} = \{\alpha\alpha, \alpha\beta, \beta\alpha, \beta\beta\}`$

where $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are primitive binary states, and $`\omega_{ij}`$ represents the combination of two basic states.

Composite states create the first truly multi-dimensional state space, making interactions between states and complex evolution possible. This compositional structure forms the basis for information encoding and processing, allowing the expression of more complex state relationships.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Composite States

The composite state system has the following basic properties:

1. **Four-State Completeness**: The composite system is entirely constituted by four basic composite states:
   $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\}`$

2. **Orthogonal Completeness**: The four composite states form an orthogonal complete basis:
   $`\sum_{i,j} |\omega_{ij}\rangle\langle\omega_{ij}| = I_{\mathcal{S}_2}`$, where $`I_{\mathcal{S}_2}`$ is the identity operator on the two-dimensional state space

3. **Compositional Closure**: Any valid combination of two composite states remains a composite state:
   $`\omega_{ij} \circ \omega_{kl} \in \mathcal{C}_2, \forall i,j,k,l \in \{0,1\}`$

4. **Permutation Transformation**: The system supports multiple non-trivial transformations, including permutations and exchanges:
   $`\mathcal{T}_{ijkl}: \omega_{ij} \mapsto \omega_{kl}`$

5. **Multi-Period Property**: The system dynamics can exhibit 2, 3, or 4 period characteristics, depending on the evolution path

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Composite Systems

The evolution of composite state systems follows more complex rules than binary systems, and can be represented as a mapping function:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{C}_2}: \omega_{ij}^t \mapsto \mathcal{F}(\omega_{ij}^t)`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the evolution function, defined as:

$`\mathcal{F}(\omega_{ij}) = \bigoplus_{k,l} M_{ij}^{kl} \omega_{kl}`$

$`M_{ij}^{kl}`$ are evolution matrix elements satisfying normalization conditions.

In special cases, XOR evolution can be defined:

$`\omega_{ij}^{t+1} = \omega_{ij}^t \oplus \omega_{kl}`$

where $`\oplus`$ is the bit-level XOR operation, and $`\omega_{kl}`$ is the operation mask.

This evolution pattern allows the system to exhibit richer dynamic behaviors than simple binary systems, supporting more complex information processing functions.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Composite States

From the composite state system's axioms, the following properties can be directly derived:

1. **State Space Four-Dimensionality**: The dimensionality of the system's state space is:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{C}_2) = \log_2 |\mathcal{C}_2| = \log_2 4 = 2`$

2. **Transformation Group Richness**: The symmetry transformation group of the system contains multiple transformations:
   $`G_{\mathcal{C}_2} = \{I, \mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2, ..., \mathcal{T}_n\}`$, where $`n > 1`$

3. **Invariant Diversity**: Multiple system invariants exist:
   $`|\mathcal{C}_2| = 4`$ (total number of states), $`\sum_{i,j} \omega_{ij} = \text{constant}`$ (sum of states), etc.

4. **Evolution Diversity**: The system can exhibit multiple different evolution patterns:
   $`\{\omega^t, \omega^{t+1}, \omega^{t+2}, ...\}`$ can form various different sequences

### 2.2 Information Properties of Composite States

The composite state system has important properties from an information theory perspective:

1. **Information Capacity**: The maximum information capacity of the system is 2 bits:
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \log_2 |\mathcal{C}_2| = \log_2 4 = 2 \text{ bits}`$

2. **Information Entropy**: The maximum entropy of the system under uniform distribution is:
   $`H_{\max}(\mathcal{C}_2) = -\sum_{i,j} \frac{1}{4} \log_2 \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ bits}`$

3. **Conditional Information**: Conditional information in the system can be non-zero:
   $`H(\omega_{ij}|\omega_{kl}) \neq 0, \text{for some} (i,j) \neq (k,l)`$

4. **Information Redundancy**: The system can exhibit information redundancy:
   $`R(\mathcal{C}_2) = \sum_{i,j} I(\omega_{ij}) - I(\mathcal{C}_2) \geq 0`$

5. **Encoding Capacity**: The system can encode 4 different states, allowing more complex information processing

### 2.3 Symmetries of Composite Systems

The composite state system exhibits multiple symmetries:

1. **Permutation Symmetry**:
   The system remains invariant under position permutation of states: $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\} \equiv \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{11}\}`$

2. **Inversion Symmetry**:
   The system remains invariant under global inversion of states: $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{flip}}(\omega_{ij}) = \omega_{\bar{i}\bar{j}}, \mathcal{T}_{\text{flip}}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \mathcal{C}_2`$

3. **Decomposition Symmetry**:
   The system can be decomposed into two subsystems: $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \mathcal{D}_1 \otimes \mathcal{D}_1`$, where $`\otimes`$ is the tensor product

4. **Transformation Group Structure**:
   The transformation group of the system can be represented as: $`G_{\mathcal{C}_2} \cong S_4`$ or its subgroups, exhibiting a richer group structure than binary systems

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Dual States to Composite States

The composite state system evolves from the binary state system:

1. **Composite Construction**:
   Constructing four-element composite states through combinations of binary states:
   $`\mathcal{D}_1 \times \mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} \times \{\alpha, \beta\} = \mathcal{C}_2`$

2. **Information Capacity Extension**:
   Information capacity extends from 1 bit to 2 bits:
   $`I(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \text{ bit} \mapsto I(\mathcal{C}_2) = 2 \text{ bits}`$

3. **State Space Dimensional Extension**:
   State space dimension extends from 1-dimensional to 2-dimensional:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \mapsto \dim(\mathcal{C}_2) = 2`$

4. **Evolution Complexity Increase**:
   Evolution possibilities increase from 2 to 16:
   $`|\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{D}_1}| = 2 \mapsto |\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{C}_2}| = 4^2 = 16`$

### 3.2 Relationship Between Composite States and XOR

The composite state system has a direct correspondence relationship with XOR operations:

1. **State Space Isomorphism**:
   The composite state space is isomorphic to the XOR operation space:
   $`\mathcal{C}_2 \cong \{00, 01, 10, 11\}`$, binary representation

2. **XOR Operation Implementation**:
   XOR operation on composite states can be represented as:
   $`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl} = \omega_{i \oplus k, j \oplus l}`$,
   where $`i \oplus k`$ represents the binary bit XOR operation

3. **Operation Closure**:
   XOR operation is closed on the composite state space:
   $`\forall \omega_{ij}, \omega_{kl} \in \mathcal{C}_2: \omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl} \in \mathcal{C}_2`$

4. **XOR Transformation Group Properties**:
   XOR operation forms an Abelian group on composite states:
   $`(G_{\oplus}, \oplus) \cong (Z_2 \times Z_2, \oplus)`$

### 3.3 Extension from Composite States to SHIFT

The composite state system lays the foundation for SHIFT operations:

1. **Composite State Serialization**:
   Composite states can be serialized into an ordered structure:
   $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\} \mapsto (\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11})`$

2. **Shift Operation Definition**:
   Defining shift operations on the serialized structure:
   $`\text{SHIFT}((\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11})) = (\omega_{11}, \omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10})`$

3. **Combination of SHIFT and XOR**:
   SHIFT can be implemented through XOR:
   $`\text{SHIFT}(\omega_{ij}) = \omega_{ij} \oplus \Delta_{\tau}`$,
   where $`\Delta_{\tau}`$ is a specific shift amount

4. **Dimensional Extension**:
   SHIFT operation extends the system from dimension 2 to dimension 3:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{C}_2) = 2 \mapsto \dim(\text{SHIFT}) = 3`$

## 4. Application and Verification

1. **Widespread Existence of Four-State Basic Structures**:
   A large number of basic systems based on four-state structures should exist in nature

3. **Widespread Existence of XOR Relationships**:

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Completeness of Composite State System**

The composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\}`$ forms a complete basis for the two-dimensional state space $`\mathcal{S}_2`$.

*Proof*:
According to Axiom 2, any two different composite states $`\omega_{ij}`$ and $`\omega_{kl}`$ satisfy:
$`\langle \omega_{ij} | \omega_{kl} \rangle = \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl}`$

This indicates that the composite state set $`\{\omega_{ij}\}`$ is orthogonal.

Since $`|\mathcal{C}_2| = 4 = 2^2`$, which matches the dimensionality of the two-dimensional state space, and the composite states are mutually orthogonal,
the set $`\{\omega_{ij}\}`$ constitutes an orthogonal basis for $`\mathcal{S}_2`$.

Furthermore, any state $`\psi \in \mathcal{S}_2`$ can be represented as a linear combination of composite states:
$`\psi = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} \omega_{ij}`$, where $`c_{ij} = \langle \omega_{ij} | \psi \rangle`$

Therefore, the composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ is complete in the two-dimensional state space. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Capacity of Composite State System**

The maximum information capacity of the composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ is 2 bits.

*Proof*:
The information capacity of a system is defined as:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \log_2 |\mathcal{C}_2|`$

Since $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \{\omega_{00}, \omega_{01}, \omega_{10}, \omega_{11}\}`$,
we have $`|\mathcal{C}_2| = 4`$.

Therefore, $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{C}_2) = \log_2 4 = 2 \text{ bits}`$.

Furthermore, we can prove that this is the optimal encoding. If there existed an encoding scheme with information capacity exceeding 2 bits, that encoding would need to distinguish more than 4 states. However, according to Axiom 1, the system has only 4 basic states, so it is impossible for an encoding scheme to exceed 2 bits. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Group Properties of XOR Operation**

The XOR operation $`\oplus`$ defined on the composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ forms an Abelian group $`(G_{\oplus}, \oplus)`$.

*Proof*:
To prove that $`(G_{\oplus}, \oplus)`$ is a group, we need to verify the four group axioms:

1. **Closure**:
   For any $`\omega_{ij}, \omega_{kl} \in \mathcal{C}_2`$,
   $`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl} = \omega_{i \oplus k, j \oplus l} \in \mathcal{C}_2`$
   
2. **Associativity**:
   For any $`\omega_{ij}, \omega_{kl}, \omega_{mn} \in \mathcal{C}_2`$,
   $`(\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl}) \oplus \omega_{mn} = \omega_{ij} \oplus (\omega_{kl} \oplus \omega_{mn})`$
   
   because binary XOR satisfies associativity.
   
3. **Identity Element**:
   $`\omega_{00}`$ is the identity element, because for any $`\omega_{ij} \in \mathcal{C}_2`$,
   $`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{00} = \omega_{i \oplus 0, j \oplus 0} = \omega_{ij}`$
   
4. **Inverse Element**:
   Each element is its own inverse, because
   $`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{ij} = \omega_{i \oplus i, j \oplus j} = \omega_{00}`$

Additionally, XOR satisfies commutativity:
$`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl} = \omega_{i \oplus k, j \oplus l} = \omega_{k \oplus i, l \oplus j} = \omega_{kl} \oplus \omega_{ij}`$

Therefore, $`(G_{\oplus}, \oplus)`$ is an Abelian group, isomorphic to $`Z_2 \times Z_2`$. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Composite State System and Cosmic Ontology**

The composite state system $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. In the composite state system:
   - FLIP operation can be represented as a specific XOR: $`\text{FLIP}(\omega_{ij}) = \omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{11}`$
   - XOR operation is the basic operation of the composite state system: $`\omega_{ij} \oplus \omega_{kl} = \omega_{i \oplus k, j \oplus l}`$
   - SHIFT operation can be implemented through composite state serialization and cyclic permutation

2. The recursive self-referential structure of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   The evolution equation of the composite state system $`\omega_{ij}^{t+1} = \omega_{ij}^t \oplus \omega_{kl}`$ can be viewed as an implementation of the self-referential structure
   
3. The binary unity axiom of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   The composite state system can be decomposed into two subsystems: $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \mathcal{D}_1 \otimes \mathcal{D}_1`$, corresponding to the binary unity structure
   
4. The information processing capability of the composite state system is compatible with the information ontology of cosmic ontology:
   The 2-bit capacity of $`\mathcal{C}_2`$ supports basic information encoding and processing functions

Therefore, the composite state system is completely compatible with the cosmic ontology theoretical framework and can be viewed as a direct implementation of cosmic ontology in dimension 2. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The primitive composition theory is positioned as a dimension 2 theory in the cosmic ontology theoretical spectrum for the following reasons:

1. **State Space Dimension**: $`\dim(\mathcal{C}_2) = \log_2 |\mathcal{C}_2| = \log_2 4 = 2`$

2. **Operation Complexity**: The system supports $`2^2 = 4`$ basic transformation operations (different XOR operations)
   - Dimension 1 theory supports 1 basic operation (FLIP)
   - Dimension 2 theory supports multiple combination operations (XOR)

3. **Information Capacity**: $`I(\mathcal{C}_2) = 2 \text{ bits}`$, corresponding exactly to dimension 2

4. **Compositional Relationship**: The composite state system can be represented as the combination of two dimension 1 systems:
   $`\mathcal{C}_2 = \mathcal{D}_1 \otimes \mathcal{D}_1`$
