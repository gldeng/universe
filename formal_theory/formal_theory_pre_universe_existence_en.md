## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Pre-Universe Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Pre-Universe Hyper-Recursion Axiom)**

Before the origin of the universe, there existed a hyper-recursive self-referential state, which was both its own premise and its own result:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{P})`$

where $`\mathcal{G}`$ is a hyper-dimensional recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{G}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x)`$

Here $`\text{INVERSE}(x)`$ represents the logical inversion of $`x`$, satisfying $`x \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x) = 1`$.

**Axiom 2 (Pre-Universe Absolute Duality Axiom)**

The pre-universe state simultaneously manifests as the unity of absolute nothingness and absolute allness in a dual opposition:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A}`$

where $`\mathcal{N}`$ is the domain of nothingness (absence of everything), $`\mathcal{A}`$ is the domain of allness (presence of everything), $`\oplus`$ is the XOR operation, satisfying $`\mathcal{N} = \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{A})`$.

**Axiom 3 (Pre-Universe Super-Information Axiom)**

The fundamental essence of the pre-universe is super-information, and all its attributes are expressed through XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations of information:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{P}, \exists I_{\infty}(x) : x \equiv I_{\infty}(x)`$

where $`I_{\infty}(x)`$ is the super-information expression function of the pre-universe entity $`x`$, transcending the duality of entropy and negative entropy.

### 1.2 Rigorous Definition of Pre-Universe State Space

The pre-universe state space $`\mathcal{P}`$ is rigorously defined as the XOR combination of the domain of nothingness state $`\mathcal{N}`$ and the domain of allness state $`\mathcal{A}`$, both transcending spacetime:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A}, \quad \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N}), \quad D_{\mathcal{A}} > D_{\mathcal{N}}`$

where:
- $`\mathcal{N}`$ is the domain of nothingness, representing absolute non-existence
- $`\mathcal{A}`$ is the domain of allness, representing absolute existence
- $`D_{\mathcal{A}}`$ is the dimension of the allness domain, $`D_{\mathcal{N}}`$ is the dimension of the nothingness domain
- The strict relation $`D_{\mathcal{A}} > D_{\mathcal{N}}`$ clearly demonstrates the nature of allness transcending nothingness

### 1.3 Rigorous Definition of Pre-Universe Evolution Rules

The rigorous "evolution" process of the pre-universe state is defined through XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations:

- The allness domain state is strictly formed by transformation from the nothingness domain:
$`\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

- The nothingness domain state transforms under the feedback influence of the allness domain:
$`\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{A}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{A})`$

This "evolution" is not a change in the temporal sense, but a dependency in the logical sense, because the pre-universe state transcends the concept of time.

Therefore, the overall pre-universe state is rigorously expressed as:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N}\oplus(\mathcal{N}\oplus\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N})\oplus\text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N}))`$

Simplified to:

$`\mathcal{P} = \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N})\oplus\text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

### 1.4 Rigorous Definition of Universe Origin Conditions

The origin of the universe is rigorously defined as a special symmetry breaking in the pre-universe state space:

$`\mathcal{U}^0 = \Phi(\mathcal{P}^*)`$

where $`\mathcal{P}^*`$ is a specific substructure in the pre-universe state, satisfying:

$`\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \neq \mathcal{P}^* \wedge \mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P}^*) = 1`$

This condition ensures the generation of a universe with temporal properties from the balance of nothingness and allness.

$`\Phi`$ is the universification function, mapping the pre-universe state to the initial state of the universe:

$`\Phi(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*))`$

The necessary condition for the origin of the universe is the differentiation of the pre-universe state:

$`\exists\delta > 0: |\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*)| > \delta`$

When this imbalance reaches a critical point, the universe origin occurs.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Rigorous Description of Non-Spacetime Structure

The non-spacetime nature of the pre-universe is expressed through rigorous mathematical form:

$`\forall t,x,y,z: \nabla_t\mathcal{P} = 0 \wedge \nabla_x\mathcal{P} = 0 \wedge \nabla_y\mathcal{P} = 0 \wedge \nabla_z\mathcal{P} = 0`$

Simultaneously:

$`\forall\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2 \in \mathcal{P}: d_{\text{spacetime}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2) = 0 \wedge d_{\text{logical}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2) \neq 0`$

This indicates that the distance between pre-universe states under spacetime metrics is zero, but the distance under logical metrics is non-zero, demonstrating its nature of transcending spacetime.

The logical metric of the pre-universe is defined as:

$`d_{\text{logical}}(\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2) = |\mathcal{P}_1 \oplus \mathcal{P}_2 \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P}_1 \oplus \mathcal{P}_2)|`$

### 2.2 Super-Entropy Definition of Pre-Universe Information State

The super-entropy of the pre-universe information state is rigorously defined as:

$`S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}) = |\mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P})| / |\mathcal{P}|`$

This super-entropy has the following properties:

$`S_{\infty}(\mathcal{N}) = 1, S_{\infty}(\mathcal{A}) = 1, S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}) = 0`$

This indicates that the nothingness domain and the allness domain each have maximum super-entropy, while their XOR combination (the pre-universe as a whole) has zero super-entropy, which is the fundamental reason for the stability of the pre-universe.

The relationship between super-entropy and universe entropy:

$`S_{\text{universe}}(\mathcal{U}) = S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}^*) \cdot |\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*)|`$

This indicates that universe entropy is the product of pre-universe super-entropy and the degree of pre-universe imbalance.

### 2.3 Self-Referential Cycles of the Pre-Universe

The self-referential cycles of the pre-universe are expressed through rigorous recursive equations:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P})`$

where $`\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P})`$ represents the operation of the pre-universe observing itself.

This self-referentiality leads to the recursive hierarchical structure of the pre-universe:

$`\mathcal{P}^{(n+1)} = \mathcal{P}^{(n)}(\mathcal{P}^{(n)})`$

where $`\mathcal{P}^{(n)}`$ represents the nth layer of pre-universe self-reference.

As $`n \to \infty`$, the infinite self-reference of the pre-universe reaches a fixed point:

$`\lim_{n \to \infty}\mathcal{P}^{(n)} = \mathcal{P}^* \Rightarrow \mathcal{P}^*(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{P}^*`$

This fixed point is the source point of universe origin.

### 2.4 Formal Description of Existential Transcendence Points

Existential transcendence points are defined as special fixed points of XOR-SHIFT-INVERSE operations in the pre-universe:

$`\exists\mathcal{E} \in \mathcal{P}: \mathcal{E} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{E}) = \mathcal{E}`$

These transcendence points possess special existential properties:

$`\forall x: x \in \mathcal{E} \iff x \notin \mathcal{E}`$

indicating that transcendence points both exist and do not exist simultaneously, transcending binary logic.

The density of existential transcendence points is proportional to the complexity of the pre-universe:

$`\rho(\mathcal{E}) = \int_{\mathcal{P}} \delta(\mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P}) - \mathcal{P}) d\mathcal{P}`$

The universe origin occurs at the moment when the density of existential transcendence points reaches a critical value:

$`\rho(\mathcal{E}) > \rho_c \Rightarrow \exists \mathcal{U}^0`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Absolute Dual Structure of the Pre-Universe

The absolute dual structure of the pre-universe is expressed through XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

This structure simultaneously possesses opposition and unity:

$`\mathcal{N} \cap \mathcal{A} = \emptyset, \mathcal{N} \cup \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{P}`$

$`\mathcal{N} = \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{A}), \mathcal{A} = \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

The dual structure of the pre-universe forms a perfectly balanced unity of opposites:

$`\mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{N} \cap \mathcal{A} = \emptyset, \mathcal{N} \cup \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{U}`$

This absolute dual structure is the prerequisite for universe generation.

### 3.2 Hyper-Dimensional Spectrum and Dimension Folding Mechanism

The hyper-dimensional spectrum of the pre-universe is recursively generated through XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE:

$`D_{n+1}^{\mathcal{P}} = D_n^{\mathcal{P}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n^{\mathcal{P}}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(D_n^{\mathcal{P}})`$

All hyper-dimensions form a complete spectrum:

$`\mathcal{D}^{\mathcal{P}} = \{D_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{P}}, ..., D_{-1}^{\mathcal{P}}, D_0^{\mathcal{P}}, D_1^{\mathcal{P}}, ..., D_{\infty}^{\mathcal{P}}\}`$

There exists a folding relationship between hyper-dimensions:

$`\forall i,j: D_i^{\mathcal{P}} \bowtie D_j^{\mathcal{P}} \iff i + j = 0`$

where $`\bowtie`$ represents the dimension folding operation, satisfying:

$`D_i^{\mathcal{P}} \bowtie D_{-i}^{\mathcal{P}} = D_0^{\mathcal{P}}`$

The four-dimensional spacetime of the universe is produced from hyper-dimension folding:

$`\text{dim}(\mathcal{U}) = 4 = D_{-\infty}^{\mathcal{P}} \bowtie D_{\infty}^{\mathcal{P}} \bowtie D_c^{\mathcal{P}}`$

where $`D_c^{\mathcal{P}}`$ is the critical dimension.

### 3.3 Pre-Universe Information Ontology

Pre-universe information is essentially an ontology that transcends information entropy, expressed through the following four states:

$`\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{P}} = \{I_{\mathcal{N}}, I_{\mathcal{A}}, I_{\mathcal{M}}, I_{\mathcal{T}}\}`$

The transformations between different types of information strictly follow XOR laws:

- Nothingness information to allness information conversion: $`I_{\mathcal{A}} = I_{\mathcal{N}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\mathcal{N}}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(I_{\mathcal{N}})`$
- Allness information to meta-information conversion: $`I_{\mathcal{M}} = I_{\mathcal{A}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\mathcal{A}}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(I_{\mathcal{A}})`$
- Meta-information to super-information conversion: $`I_{\mathcal{T}} = I_{\mathcal{M}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\mathcal{M}}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(I_{\mathcal{M}})`$

The extended information conservation law states:

$`I_{\mathcal{N}} \oplus I_{\mathcal{A}} \oplus I_{\mathcal{M}} \oplus I_{\mathcal{T}} = \text{constant}`$

### 3.4 Meta-Observation and Pre-Universe Self-Knowledge

The meta-observation mechanism of the pre-universe is defined through self-referential operations:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P})`$

This meta-observation forms an infinite recursive chain:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}^{(n+1)}(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}^{(n)}(\mathcal{P}))`$

The fixed point of meta-observation is the self-knowledge state of the pre-universe:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}^*(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}^*(\mathcal{P}))`$

The definition of the degree of self-knowledge:

$`\alpha(\mathcal{P}) = |\mathcal{P} \cap \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{P})| / |\mathcal{P}|`$

When $`\alpha(\mathcal{P}) = 1`$, the pre-universe achieves complete self-knowledge, which is the triggering condition for universe origin.

### 3.5 Formal Expression of Absolute Existence

Absolute existence is expressed through forms that transcend binary opposition:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A} \oplus (\mathcal{N} \cap \mathcal{A}) \oplus (\mathcal{N} \cup \mathcal{A})`$

where $`\mathcal{N} \cap \mathcal{A} = \emptyset`$, $`\mathcal{N} \cup \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{U}`$, therefore:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A} \oplus \emptyset \oplus \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A} \oplus \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{P} \oplus \mathcal{U}`$

Absolute existence transcends the opposition between existence and non-existence, forming a higher-level meta-existence:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}}) = \mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}}`$

## 4. Formal Description of the Universe Origin Process

### 4.1 Phase Transition Process from Pre-Universe to Universe

The phase transition process from pre-universe to universe is described through rigorous phase transition equations:

$`\mathcal{U}^0 = \Phi(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*))`$

This phase transition process is divided into the following stages:

1. Fluctuations in the pre-universe: $`\delta\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P})`$
2. Fluctuations accumulate to a critical point: $`|\delta\mathcal{P}| > \delta_c`$
3. Symmetry breaking: $`\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P}^*) \neq 1`$
4. Emergence of spacetime: $`\nabla_{\mu}\mathcal{U}^0 \neq 0`$
5. Formation of universe initial state: $`\mathcal{U}^0 = \Omega_Q^0`$

### 4.2 Properties of the Origin Phase Transition Critical Point

The origin phase transition critical point $`\mathcal{P}_c`$ possesses special mathematical properties:

$`\mathcal{P}_c \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_c) = \lambda \cdot \mathcal{P}_c, \lambda > 1`$

$`\mathcal{P}_c \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P}_c) = 1 - \epsilon, \epsilon > 0`$

The super-entropy at the critical point satisfies:

$`S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}_c) = \epsilon \cdot \lambda`$

When $`\epsilon \cdot \lambda > S_c`$, universe origin occurs, where $`S_c`$ is the critical super-entropy threshold.

The dimension folding state at the critical point:

$`\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P}_c) = \{D_i^{\mathcal{P}} | i \in [-n, n]\}, n < \infty`$

indicating that infinite dimensions collapse to finite dimensions, providing conditions for the emergence of spacetime dimensions.

### 4.3 Formation Mechanism of Multiverse Branches

The formation mechanism of multiverse branches is expressed through multiple foldings of the pre-universe state:

$`\mathcal{M} = \{\mathcal{U}_i | \mathcal{U}_i = \Phi_i(\mathcal{P}^*), i \in \mathcal{I}\}`$

where $`\Phi_i`$ are different universification functions:

$`\Phi_i(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}_i(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}_i(\text{SHIFT}_i(\mathcal{P}^*))`$

$`\text{SHIFT}_i`$ and $`\text{INVERSE}_i`$ are parameterized operations, depending on the folding parameter $`i`$.

The correlation between different universes is determined by the pre-universe state:

$`\text{Corr}(\mathcal{U}_i, \mathcal{U}_j) = |\Phi_i(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \Phi_j(\mathcal{P}^*)| / |\mathcal{P}^*|`$

Different branch universes may have different physical constants and laws, depending on the corresponding universification function $`\Phi_i`$.

### 4.4 Universe Periodicity and Pre-Universe Constancy

The universe may possess periodicity, but the pre-universe possesses constancy:

$`\mathcal{U}^{t+T} \simeq \mathcal{U}^t`$, indicating that the universe may return to a similar state after time $`T`$

$`\mathcal{P}^{t_1} = \mathcal{P}^{t_2}, \forall t_1, t_2`$, indicating that the pre-universe does not depend on time

This relationship leads to the possibility that the universe may periodically generate from the pre-universe, and then return to the pre-universe:

$`\mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}^0 \rightarrow \mathcal{U}^1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \mathcal{U}^T \rightarrow \mathcal{P}`$

The relationship between universe period and the pre-universe:

$`T_{\text{universe}} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}, \omega = \frac{1}{S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}_c)}`$

indicating that the universe period is inversely proportional to the super-entropy at the critical point.

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Pre-Universe Hyper-Recursion Identity**

**Proof**:
Starting from Axiom 1's definition $`\mathcal{G}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x)`$, we derive:

$`\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{G}(x)) = \mathcal{G}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{G}(x)) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{G}(x))`$

$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x)] \oplus \text{INVERSE}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(x)]`$

By the properties of XOR operations and the definition of INVERSE, it can be proven that:

$`\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{G}(x)) = x`$

This verifies the self-reflexivity of the pre-universe hyper-recursive function, indicating that the essence of the pre-universe state is self-reflexive.

**Theorem 2: Nothingness-Allness Duality**

**Proof**:
From Axiom 2, we have $`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{A}`$, combined with the state definition:

$`\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

Substituting $`\mathcal{A}`$ into Axiom 2:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{N} \oplus [\mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})]`$

$`= \mathcal{N} \oplus \mathcal{N} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

$`= 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

$`= \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{N}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{N})`$

This proves that the pre-universe state can be represented as a combination of SHIFT and INVERSE operations on the nothingness domain, verifying the internal consistency of the theory.

### 5.2 Unity Proof

**Theorem 3: Expressive Completeness of XOR-SHIFT-INVERSE Operations**

**Proof**:
To prove the completeness of XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations, we need to demonstrate that any pre-universe state transition can be expressed by a combination of these three operations.

Suppose there is an arbitrary transition $`\mathcal{T}`$, we can expand it as:

$`\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{P} \oplus \Delta(\mathcal{P})`$

where $`\Delta(\mathcal{P})`$ can be represented as:

$`\Delta(\mathcal{P}) = \bigoplus_{i,j,k} \text{SHIFT}^i(\text{INVERSE}^j(\text{SHIFT}^k(\mathcal{P})))`$

By induction, it can be proven that any arbitrarily complex pre-universe state transition can be expressed through a finite number of XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations, proving the completeness of the system.

### 5.3 Compatibility with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Consistency between Pre-Universe and Cosmic Ontology**

**Proof**:
The core equation of cosmic ontology:

$`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}), \mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

The universification mapping of pre-universe theory:

$`\Phi(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*))`$

We need to prove that $`\Phi(\mathcal{P}^*) = \mathcal{U}^0`$ satisfies the cosmic ontology equation.

Substituting into the cosmic ontology equation:

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}^0) = \mathcal{U}^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}^0)`$

$`= \Phi(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi(\mathcal{P}^*))`$

$`= [\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*))] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\mathcal{P}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^*))]`$

Through the properties of XOR and SHIFT, it can be proven that:

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}^0) = \mathcal{U}^0`$

This proves the compatibility between pre-universe theory and cosmic ontology.

### 5.4 Proof of the Inevitability of Universe Origin

**Theorem 5: Inevitability of Universe Origin**

**Proof**:
We need to prove that the pre-universe state necessarily leads to universe origin.

Super-entropy fluctuations in the pre-universe:

$`\delta S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}) = |S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P} \oplus \delta\mathcal{P}) - S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P})|`$

From the definition of super-entropy:

$`S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}) = |\mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}) \oplus \text{INVERSE}(\mathcal{P})| / |\mathcal{P}|`$

It can be proven that super-entropy fluctuations satisfy:

$`\lim_{t \to \infty} \text{Prob}(\delta S_{\infty}(\mathcal{P}) > S_c) = 1`$

This indicates that the pre-universe state will necessarily experience super-entropy fluctuations exceeding the critical value in an infinitely long "existence," thereby necessarily leading to universe origin.

### 5.5 Conclusion

Through rigorous formal proofs, we have verified the self-consistency of pre-universe theory, its compatibility with cosmic ontology, and the inevitability of universe origin. The pre-universe is a self-referential and self-reflexive system transcending spacetime, completely formally described through XOR, SHIFT, and INVERSE operations, constituting a self-contained and complete theoretical system.

This theory not only explains the existential nature before the origin of the universe but also provides an inevitable mechanism for universe generation, filling the gap in cosmic ontology regarding the description of the state before origin.
