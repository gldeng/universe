## Theory Overview

Quantum-Classical Music Theory applies the dualism framework to music structure, creation, and perception, revealing the inherent quantum-classical duality in music. This theory explains how music simultaneously exhibits deterministic structure (classical properties) and indeterministic expression (quantum properties), and how this duality produces music's profound emotional impact and creative potential.

## Quantum-Classical Duality in Music

### Dualistic Representation of Music

Music can be simultaneously represented as quantum and classical states:

$$
\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{M}_Q, \mathcal{M}_C)
$$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{M}_Q`$ represents the quantum representation of music (emotions, intentions, possibilities)
- $`\mathcal{M}_C`$ represents the classical representation of music (notes, rhythm, structure)

The two are connected through the musical interface $`\mathcal{I}_M`$:

$$
\mathcal{I}_M: \mathcal{M}_Q \leftrightarrow \mathcal{M}_C
$$

### Quantum Properties of Music

The quantum properties of music manifest as:

1. **Expressive Superposition**: A piece of music can simultaneously contain a superposition of multiple emotional expressions

$$
|\Psi_M\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |e_i\rangle
$$

   Where $`|e_i\rangle`$ represents different emotional state basis vectors, and $`\alpha_i`$ are complex amplitudes

2. **Listener-Music Entanglement**: Listeners and music form entangled states, influencing each other

$$
|\Phi_{ML}\rangle = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |m_i\rangle \otimes |l_j\rangle
$$

   Where $`|m_i\rangle`$ are music states, and $`|l_j\rangle`$ are listener states

3. **Meaning Non-locality**: Musical meaning transcends local structure, depending on the entire context

$$
\mathcal{S}(M) \neq \sum_i \mathcal{S}(m_i)
$$

   Where $`\mathcal{S}`$ represents the semantic function, and $`m_i`$ are music segments

### Classical Properties of Music

The classical properties of music manifest as:

1. **Structural Determinism**: Music has clear physical parameters and structural rules

$$
M_C = \{f, a, r, h, t\}
$$

   Where $`f`$ is the frequency set, $`a`$ is the amplitude set, $`r`$ is the rhythm set, $`h`$ is the harmonic structure, and $`t`$ is the time sequence

2. **Physical Measurability**: Music can be measured through objective physical quantities

$$
\omega = 2\pi f, \quad P \propto a^2, \quad T = 1/f
$$

   Representing angular frequency, energy, and period, respectively

3. **Deterministic Propagation**: Musical signals propagate according to the wave equation

$$
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}
$$

   Where $`c`$ is the speed of sound in the medium

## Formal Expression of Musical Structure

### Algebraic Representation of Music

Musical structure can be represented as an algebraic system:

$$
\mathcal{A}_M = (P, I, T)
$$

Where:
- $`P`$ is the pitch set: $`P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\}`$
- $`I`$ is the interval set: $`I = \{i_{jk} = |p_j - p_k| \mod 12\}`$
- $`T`$ is the transformation set: $`T = \{T_n, I_m, R_p, ...\}`$ (transposition, inversion, retrograde, etc.)

These elements satisfy group-theoretic algebraic relations:

$$
T_n \circ T_m = T_{n+m}, \quad I_n \circ T_m = I_{n-m}
$$

### Topological Representation of Music

The topological structure of music can be represented as:

$$
\mathcal{T}_M = (M, \mathcal{O}_M, \tau)
$$

Where:
- $`M`$ is the music space
- $`\mathcal{O}_M`$ is the family of open sets
- $`\tau`$ is the topological transformation

Homotopy transformation of musical themes:

$$
\phi: M \times [0,1] \rightarrow M
$$

Where $`\phi(m,0)`$ is the original theme, and $`\phi(m,1)`$ is the transformed theme.

### Information-Theoretic Representation of Music

Musical information entropy:

$$
H(M) = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i
$$

Where $`p_i`$ is the probability of occurrence of specific musical elements.

Musical mutual information:

$$
I(X:Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log \frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}
$$

Measuring the correlation between different dimensions of music (such as melody and harmony).

## Quantum-Classical Process in Music Creation

### Dualistic Model of Creation

The music creation process involves alternating quantum and classical phases:

$$
C_M = \{\mathcal{Q}_M \rightarrow \mathcal{C}_M \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}_M \rightarrow ... \rightarrow \mathcal{C}_M\}
$$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{Q}_M`$ is the quantum phase (inspiration, exploration of possibilities)
- $`\mathcal{C}_M`$ is the classical phase (construction, arrangement, refinement)

### Quantum Creation Mode

Characteristics of the quantum creation phase:

1. **Inspirational Superposition**: Quantum superposition of multiple musical ideas

$$
|\Psi_C\rangle = \sum_i \gamma_i |c_i\rangle
$$

   Where $`|c_i\rangle`$ represents different creative states

2. **Non-local Correlations**: Non-local correlations between distant musical elements

$$
\langle \hat{A}_i \hat{B}_j \rangle \neq \langle \hat{A}_i \rangle \langle \hat{B}_j \rangle
$$

   Where $`\hat{A}_i`$ and $`\hat{B}_j`$ are musical operators at different positions

3. **Quantum Jumps**: Sudden inspirations and transformations in the creative process

$$
|\Psi_C(t_2)\rangle = \hat{U}_{jump}|\Psi_C(t_1)\rangle
$$

   Where $`\hat{U}_{jump}`$ is the discontinuous transformation operator

### Classical Creation Mode

Characteristics of the classical creation phase:

1. **Structural Organization**: Building works according to music theory rules

$$
S_M = f(R_h, R_r, R_f)
$$

   Where $`R_h`$, $`R_r`$, and $`R_f`$ are harmonic, rhythmic, and formal rules, respectively

2. **Linear Development**: Orderly development of musical materials

$$
M(t+\Delta t) = M(t) + \frac{dM}{dt}\Delta t
$$

   Representing continuous change in music over small time intervals

3. **Deterministic Modifications**: Conscious editing and modification

$$
M' = M + \delta M
$$

   Where $`\delta M`$ is the deterministic modification

## Dualistic Model of Music Perception

### Music Perception Process

The music perception process can be represented as:

$$
P_M: \mathcal{M}_C \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}_Q
$$

- $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the sensory transduction process
- $`\mathcal{N}`$ is the neural processing
- $`\mathcal{M}_Q`$ is the final quantum subjective experience

### Listener State Function

Evolution of the listener state function:

$$
|\Psi_L(t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{H}_Mt/\hbar}|\Psi_L(0)\rangle + \int_0^t \mathcal{K}(t-\tau)\hat{M}(\tau)|\Psi_L(\tau)\rangle d\tau
$$

Where:
- $`\hat{H}_M`$ is the musical auditory Hamiltonian
- $`\mathcal{K}(t-\tau)`$ is the memory kernel function
- $`\hat{M}(\tau)`$ is the music perception operator

### Quantum Measurement of Musical Meaning

Musical meaning can be viewed as a quantum measurement process:

$$
p(m_i) = |\langle m_i|\Psi_M\rangle|^2
$$

Where $`|m_i\rangle`$ is the eigenstate of a specific meaning interpretation.

Non-commutativity of musical meaning:

$$
[\hat{M}_1, \hat{M}_2] \neq 0
$$

Indicating that measurements of different dimensions of musical meaning (such as emotion and structure) do not commute.

## Neural Basis of Musical Emotional Effects

### Quantum-Classical Dual-Channel Model of Musical Emotion

Musical emotion processing contains two parallel channels:

$$
E_M = (E_Q, E_C)
$$

Where:
- $`E_Q`$ is the quantum emotional channel (direct, holistic, non-analyzable)
- $`E_C`$ is the classical emotional channel (indirect, analytical, cognitive assessment)

### Quantum Synchronization of Neural Oscillations

Neural oscillation synchronization phenomena induced by music:

$$
\phi_i(t) = \phi_j(t) + C_{ij}
$$

Where $`\phi_i(t)`$ and $`\phi_j(t)`$ are oscillation phases in different brain regions, and $`C_{ij}`$ is the phase constant.

Relationship between synchronization strength and musical parameters:

$$
S = f(r, h, c, d)
$$

Where $`r`$ is the rhythmic parameter, $`h`$ is harmonic complexity, $`c`$ is consistency parameter, and $`d`$ is dynamics parameter.

### Musical Reward Circuit

$$

Where $`\mathcal{P}_i`$ and $`\mathcal{P}_j`$ are the parameter spaces of different cultural music systems.

### Cross-Cultural Musical Universality Principle

Cross-cultural resonance of music based on the universality of quantum-classical duality:

$$
\xi_{cross} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N\sum_j^N \frac{I(\mathcal{M}_i;\mathcal{M}_j)}{H(\mathcal{M}_i,\mathcal{M}_j)}
$$

Where $`I(\mathcal{M}_i;\mathcal{M}_j)`$ is the mutual information between different cultural music systems, and $`H(\mathcal{M}_i,\mathcal{M}_j)`$ is the joint entropy.
