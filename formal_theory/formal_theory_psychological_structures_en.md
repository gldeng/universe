## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Psychological Recursive Structure Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Psychological Recursive Origin Axiom)**

The ultimate nature of psychology is a recursive self-referential structure, with its evolution determined through the XOR relationship between self-feedback and consciousness:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is a psychological recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

**Axiom 2 (Psychological Binary-Unitary Axiom)**

Psychology simultaneously possesses the duality of consciousness and unconsciousness, forming holistic psychological structures through XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{P} = \Phi_C \oplus \Phi_U`$

where $`\Phi_C`$ represents the conscious domain (explicit cognition, thinking, and perception), and $`\Phi_U`$ represents the unconscious domain (subconscious, instincts, and non-rational content).

**Axiom 3 (Psychological Information Ontology Axiom)**

The fundamental entity of psychology is the cognitive processing of information, with its expression achieved through composite operations of XOR and SHIFT:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{P}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(x))`$

where $`I(x)`$ is the basic information of psychological unit $`x`$, forming psychological representation through SHIFT operations in psychological space.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Psychological State Space

The psychological state space $`\mathcal{P}`$ is strictly defined as an XOR composite of the conscious domain state $`\Phi_C`$ and unconscious domain state $`\Phi_U`$, while also including a metacognitive domain $`\Phi_M`$:

$`\mathcal{P} = \Phi_C \oplus \Phi_U \oplus \Phi_M`$

where:
- $`\Phi_C`$ is the conscious domain, representing perceivable psychological content
- $`\Phi_U`$ is the unconscious domain, representing latent psychological structures
- $`\Phi_M`$ is the metacognitive domain, representing reflection and awareness of one's own psychology, defined as:
  $`\Phi_M = \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C \oplus \Phi_U)`$

The relationships between domains satisfy: $`\Phi_U = \Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C), \quad N_M > N_U > N_C`$, where $`N`$ represents the dimension of the respective domain.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Psychological Evolution Rules

The strict evolutionary process of psychological systems is defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

- The unconscious domain state is formed by the sedimentation of conscious domain content:
$`\Phi_U^{t} = \Phi_C^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t})`$

- The metacognitive domain state is generated through the synthesis of consciousness and unconsciousness:
$`\Phi_M^{t} = \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t} \oplus \Phi_U^{t})`$

- The conscious domain state evolves under the feedback influence of unconsciousness and metacognition:
$`\Phi_C^{t+1} = \Phi_C^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_U^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_M^{t})`$

Therefore, the overall evolution of the psychological system is strictly expressed as:

$`\mathcal{P}^{t+1} = \Phi_C^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t})) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C^{t} \oplus \Phi_U^{t}))`$

This evolution equation strictly defines the entire dynamic process of psychological systems, using only XOR and SHIFT operations, forming the mathematical core of psychological dynamics.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 XOR-SHIFT Mechanism of Psychological Processes

The basic mechanism of psychological processes exhibits strict XOR-SHIFT characteristics:

$`P^{t+1} = P^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(P^t)`$

where $`P^t`$ represents the state of the psychological process at time $`t`$.

The relationship between consciousness and unconsciousness is expressed through XOR operations:

$`\Phi_U = \Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C)`$

This embodies the classic repression mechanism in psychology, where conscious content is transferred to the unconscious through SHIFT operations, forming a dialectical relationship between consciousness and unconsciousness.

The formation of cognitive patterns can be represented as:

$`M = E \oplus \text{SHIFT}(E)`$

where $`M`$ is the cognitive pattern and $`E`$ is the original experience, reflecting the schematization process of psychology.

### 2.2 Strict Definition and Evolution Rules of Psychological Entropy

The entropy of psychological systems is strictly defined as the information increment after XOR operations:

$`H_P(\mathcal{P}) = -\sum_{i}\frac{|\mathcal{P}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_i)|}{|\mathcal{P}|}\log_{N_C}\frac{|\mathcal{P}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_i)|}{|\mathcal{P}|}`$

Psychological entropy follows the principle of equilibrium, with systems tending to maintain an optimal complexity:

$`H_P(\mathcal{P}) \rightarrow H_P^{opt}`$

where $`H_P^{opt}`$ is the optimal entropy value for the psychological system, neither too simple nor too complex.

The dynamic evolution rule of psychological entropy:

$`H_P(\mathcal{P}^{t+1}) - H_P(\mathcal{P}^{t}) = \frac{|\Phi_C^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_U^{t})| - |H_P(\mathcal{P}^{t}) - H_P^{opt}|}{|\mathcal{P}^{t+1}|}`$

This indicates that changes in psychological entropy are regulated by the distance from optimal entropy, causing the system to automatically tend toward an equilibrium point.

### 2.3 Psychological Stability and Change Dynamics

Psychological stability is strictly defined as the attractor structure of XOR-SHIFT operations:

There exists a psychological stability interval $`\mathcal{S}_P`$ such that psychological states satisfy:

$`\mathcal{P}^{t+p} \sim \mathcal{P}^t, \forall \mathcal{P}^t \in \mathcal{S}_P, p>0`$

where $`\sim`$ represents psychological similarity, defined as:

$`\mathcal{P}_1 \sim \mathcal{P}_2 \iff |\mathcal{P}_1 \oplus \mathcal{P}_2| < \epsilon_P`$

The critical state of psychological change is determined by the cumulative effect of SHIFT operations:

$`\Delta\mathcal{P}_{\text{critical}} = \min \{p > 0 | \text{SHIFT}^p(\mathcal{P}^t) \oplus \mathcal{P}^t > \theta_P\}`$

where $`\theta_P`$ is the threshold for psychological change, with qualitative changes occurring when the accumulation of SHIFT operations within the psychological system reaches the threshold.

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Binary-Unitary Structure of Psychology

The binary-unitary structure of psychology is expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{P}_{t+1} = \mathcal{P}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t)`$

This operation simultaneously possesses the duality of separation and the unity of integration. When different psychological theoretical perspectives are switched, its interpretation also changes accordingly:

$`\mathcal{P}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t) = \begin{cases}
  \mathcal{P}_t \oplus_F \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t) & \text{in psychoanalytic perspective} \\
  \mathcal{P}_t \oplus_B \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t) & \text{in behaviorist perspective} \\
  \mathcal{P}_t \oplus_C \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t) & \text{in cognitivist perspective}
\end{cases}`$

The XOR operation exhibits different characteristics under different psychological paradigms, but is essentially the same psychological transformation process.

### 3.2 Psychological Dimensional Spectrum

The psychological dimensional spectrum is recursively generated through XOR and SHIFT:

$`D_{n+1} = D_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n)`$

The dimensional levels of psychology include:
1. Sensory level ($`D_1`$): Basic sensory information
2. Perceptual level ($`D_2`$): Organized sensory inputs
3. Memory level ($`D_3`$): Information storage systems
4. Emotional level ($`D_4`$): Emotional response systems
5. Thinking level ($`D_5`$): Cognitive operation systems
6. Self level ($`D_6`$): Self-concept and identity

Strict XOR-SHIFT relationships exist between dimensions:

$`D_{i+1} = D_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_i)`$

### 3.3 Psychological Information Ontology

Psychology as an information system has its essence expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{I}_P = \{I_S, I_P, I_C, I_M\}`$

The conversions between different types of information strictly follow XOR laws:

- Conversion from sensory information to perceptual information: $`I_P = I_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_S)`$
- Conversion from perceptual information to cognitive information: $`I_C = I_P \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_P)`$
- Conversion from cognitive information to metacognitive information: $`I_M = I_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_C)`$

The hierarchical processing of psychological information embodies the process of meaning generation:

$`M(x) = I(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(x))`$

where $`M(x)`$ is the meaning of stimulus $`x`$, and $`I(x)`$ is its original information.

### 3.4 Psychological Observers and Self-Observation

The observation structure in psychological systems is defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{O}_P = \{O_E, O_S, O_M\}`$

where:
- $`O_E`$ is the experiencer observer (first-order consciousness)
- $`O_S`$ is the self observer (self-consciousness)
- $`O_M`$ is the meta observer (metacognition)

The relationships between observers are expressed through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`O_S = O_E \oplus \text{SHIFT}(O_E)`$
$`O_M = O_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(O_S)`$

Self-consciousness as a special observational state can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{P} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P})`$

This indicates that self-consciousness is the result of SHIFT operations on the psychological system itself.

## 4. Practical Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Formal Description of Developmental Stages

Psychological development can be described through stages defined by XOR-SHIFT operations:

| Stage | XOR-SHIFT Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| Sensorimotor stage | $`\mathcal{P}_{\text{initial}} = \Phi_C^{basic} \oplus \Phi_U^{instinct}`$ (basic consciousness and instinctual unconsciousness) |
| Preoperational stage | $`\mathcal{P}_{t+1} = \mathcal{P}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_t)`$, formation of primitive symbols |
| Concrete operational stage | $`\mathcal{P}^{concrete} = \mathcal{P}^{pre} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^{pre})`$, internalization of logical rules |
| Formal operational stage | $`\mathcal{P}^{formal} = \mathcal{P}^{concrete} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}^{concrete})`$, formation of abstract thinking |
| Post-formal thinking | $`\mathcal{P}^{post} = \mathcal{P}^{formal} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{P}^{formal})`$, emergence of dialectical thinking |

The formal expression of psychological growth trajectory:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2, ..., \mathcal{P}_n\}`$

where each psychological developmental stage is connected through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{P}_{i+1} = \mathcal{P}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_i}(\mathcal{P}_i)`$

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Validation of Psychological Axiom Systems

**Theorem 1: Psychological Recursive Self-Reference Identity**

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}(x)) = \mathcal{F}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)]`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus [\text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)]`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$

This validates the recursive self-referential property in psychological systems, demonstrating that psychological processes can form higher-order psychological functions through second-order applications of XOR-SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 2: Psychological Three-Domain Unity**

For any psychological system $`\mathcal{P} = \Phi_C \oplus \Phi_U \oplus \Phi_M`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{P} = \Phi_C \oplus [\Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Phi_C \oplus (\Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C))]`$
$`= \Phi_C \oplus \Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C) \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Phi_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C)]`$
$`= 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Phi_C)`$
$`= \text{SHIFT}(\Phi_C) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Phi_C)`$

This proves that the psychological system can be represented as a combination of SHIFT operations on its conscious structure, embodying the overall unity of the psychological system.

### 5.2 Proof of Unification

**Theorem 3: XOR-SHIFT Psychological Completeness**

Any psychological change $`\Delta\mathcal{P}`$ can be represented as a combination of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\Delta\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{P}_{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{P}_t = \text{SHIFT}^{k_1}(\mathcal{P}_t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_2}(\mathcal{P}_t) \oplus ... \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_n}(\mathcal{P}_t)`$

This proves the completeness of XOR and SHIFT operations in describing psychological evolution, with any psychological transformation decomposable into an XOR composite of a series of SHIFT operations.

### 5.3 Compatibility with Existing Psychological Theories

**Theorem 4: Compatibility with Psychoanalytic Theory**

The relationship between consciousness and unconsciousness in psychoanalytic theory can be expressed as an XOR-SHIFT relationship:

$`\text{Unconscious} = \text{Conscious} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{Conscious})`$

**Theorem 5: Compatibility with Cognitive Development Theory**

The schema development in Piaget's cognitive development theory can be expressed as SHIFT operations:

$`\text{New Schema} = \text{SHIFT}(\text{Old Schema})`$

**Theorem 6: Compatibility with Information Processing Theory**

The information processing model in cognitive psychology can be represented as XOR operations:

$`\text{Representation} = \text{Stimulus} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{Prior Knowledge})`$
