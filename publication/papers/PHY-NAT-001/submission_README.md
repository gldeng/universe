## Compiling the Submission Package

The `compile_submission.sh` script automates the compilation of all submission files and prepares the final submission package. It performs the following tasks:

1. Compiles LaTeX files to generate the manuscript and supplementary PDFs
2. Converts Markdown files to PDF where needed
3. Organizes all submission components into a structured directory
4. Creates an inventory of all submission files
5. Packages everything into a ZIP archive

### Prerequisites

Before running the compilation script, ensure you have the following installed:

- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live 2024 or newer)
- BibTeX
- Pandoc (for Markdown to PDF conversion)
- ZIP utility

### Running the Compilation Script

To compile the submission package:

```bash
cd /path/to/publication/papers/PHY-NAT-001
chmod +x compile_submission.sh
./compile_submission.sh
```

The script will create a directory `submission_package/final_submission/` containing all submission files and a ZIP archive `submission_package/PHY-NAT-001_submission.zip` with the complete package.

## Final Submission Contents

After compilation, the final submission package will contain:

1. **Main Documents:**
   - `manuscript.pdf` - The main manuscript (compiled from LaTeX)
   - `supplementary.pdf` - Supplementary materials
   - `cover_letter.pdf` - Cover letter to the editor
   - `highlights.pdf` - Research highlights

2. **Additional Documents:**
   - Author information
   - Conflict of interest statement
   - Funding statement
   - Keywords
   - Media summary
   - Open access statement
   - Reviewer suggestions
   - Ethics statement

3. **Figures:**
   - 5 high-resolution SVG figures
   - Figure descriptions

4. **Code:**
   - Simulation code and documentation
   - Data files for results validation

5. **Inventory:**
   - `001_final_submission.pdf` - Comprehensive inventory of all files
   - `submission_metadata.txt` - Key metadata for the submission

## Submission Guidelines

When submitting to Nature Physics:

1. Upload `manuscript.pdf` as the main manuscript
2. Upload `supplementary.pdf` as supplementary material
3. Upload `cover_letter.pdf` as the cover letter
4. Fill in the online submission form with information from the additional documents
5. Upload figure files individually as required
