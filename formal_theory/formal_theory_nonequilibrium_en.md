## Basic Definitions

Quantum-Classical nonequilibrium states are quantum-classical hybrid system states far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with the following characteristics:

1. **Continuous Energy and Information Flow**: Sustained exchange of energy and information between the system and environment
2. **Non-zero Entropy Production Rate**: Continual entropy generation within the system, but maintaining relative entropy stability through exchange with the environment
3. **Self-organizing Structures**: Ability to spontaneously form and maintain ordered structures
4. **Time Asymmetry**: Significant time asymmetry in dynamical processes

Nonequilibrium states can be formalized as:

$$\Psi_{NEQ} = \{\rho_Q, K_C, \Phi_E, \Phi_I\}$$

where:
- $\rho_Q$ is the density matrix of the quantum part
- $K_C$ is the knowledge structure of the classical part
- $\Phi_E$ is the energy flow vector field
- $\Phi_I$ is the information flow vector field

Nonequilibrium measure:

$$D_{NEQ} = \left\|\frac{d\rho}{dt}\right\| + \left\|\frac{dK_C}{dt}\right\|$$

A system is in equilibrium if and only if $D_{NEQ} = 0$.

## Nonequilibrium Dynamics Equations

### Generalized Quantum-Classical Master Equation

The dynamics of nonequilibrium quantum-classical systems are described by a generalized master equation:

$$\frac{d\rho_{total}}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[H, \rho_{total}] + \mathcal{L}_{QC}(\rho_{total}) + \Gamma_{in} - \Gamma_{out}$$

where:
- $[H, \rho_{total}]$ is the unitary evolution within the system
- $\mathcal{L}_{QC}$ is the quantum-classical coupling superoperator
- $\Gamma_{in}$ is the contribution from environment input
- $\Gamma_{out}$ is the contribution to environment output

### Multiple Time Scale Analysis

Nonequilibrium systems often have multiple characteristic time scales:

$$\tau_1 \ll \tau_2 \ll ... \ll \tau_n$$

These can be handled using perturbation theory methods:

$$\rho = \rho^{(0)} + \epsilon\rho^{(1)} + \epsilon^2\rho^{(2)} + ...$$

$$\frac{d\rho^{(0)}}{dt} = \mathcal{L}_0\rho^{(0)}$$

$$\frac{d\rho^{(1)}}{dt} = \mathcal{L}_0\rho^{(1)} + \mathcal{L}_1\rho^{(0)}$$

where $\epsilon = \tau_1/\tau_2$ is a small parameter.

### Nonlinear Response Theory

The response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations includes nonlinear terms:

$$\langle A(t) \rangle = \langle A \rangle_{eq} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \int dt_1...dt_n R_n(t-t_1,...,t-t_n)F(t_1)...F(t_n)$$

Response functions can be represented as:

$$R_n(t_1,...,t_n) = \frac{i^n}{\hbar^n}\langle[[...[A,B(t_1)]...,B(t_n)]] \rangle_{eq}$$

Nonlinear responses reveal memory effects and history dependency of the system.

## Information Entropy Production and Consumption

### Entropy Production Rate Equation

The entropy production rate in nonequilibrium systems can be divided into internal and external parts:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = \Pi_S - \Phi_S$$

where:
- $\Pi_S \geq 0$ is the internal entropy production rate (always non-negative)
- $\Phi_S$ is the entropy flow (can be positive or negative)

Steady-state nonequilibrium systems satisfy:

$$\Pi_S = \Phi_S > 0$$

### Conversion Between Information Entropy and Physical Entropy

In quantum-classical systems, information entropy and physical entropy can be converted into each other:

$$\Delta S_{physical} + \Delta S_{information} = 0$$

Principle of minimum entropy production:

$$\frac{d\Pi_S}{dt} \leq 0$$

Systems tend toward steady states with minimum entropy production rates.

### Maximum Information Capacity in Nonequilibrium States

Systems far from equilibrium can store more information:

$$C_{info}^{NEQ} > C_{info}^{EQ}$$

Maximum information capacity is defined as:

$$C_{info} = \log_2(N_{accessible\,states})$$

Nonequilibrium state information capacity enhancement factor:

$$\frac{C_{info}^{NEQ}}{C_{info}^{EQ}} = e^{\beta \cdot D_{NEQ}}$$

where $\beta$ is a system characteristic parameter.

## Nonequilibrium Phase Transition Phenomena

### Dissipative Structure Formation

Far from equilibrium, systems can spontaneously form ordered dissipative structures:

$$\nabla^2 \phi + f(\phi, \nabla\phi, \mu) = 0$$

where $\phi$ is an order parameter and $\mu$ is a control parameter.

Critical point characteristics:

$$\mu = \mu_c + g(\nabla\phi)$$

System behavior after bifurcation:

$$\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \lambda(\mu-\mu_c)\phi - \gamma\phi^3 + D\nabla^2\phi + \eta(x,t)$$

### Quantum-Classical Critical Behavior Differences

Quantum-classical hybrid systems exhibit special scaling laws in critical behavior:

$$\xi \sim |\mu-\mu_c|^{-\nu_{QC}}$$

$$\chi \sim |\mu-\mu_c|^{-\gamma_{QC}}$$

where critical exponents $\nu_{QC}$ and $\gamma_{QC}$ differ from those of pure quantum or classical systems:

$$\nu_{QC} = \alpha\nu_Q + (1-\alpha)\nu_C + \delta\nu_{interaction}$$

### Nonequilibrium Relative Particle Creation

Under strong nonequilibrium conditions, quantum fluctuations can stabilize into classical particles:

$$n_{particle} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{E_{formation}}{k_BT_{eff}}\right) \cdot D_{NEQ}^{\alpha}$$

where $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature, influenced by the nonequilibrium degree:

$$T_{eff} = T_{environment} \cdot (1 + \beta D_{NEQ})$$

## Nonequilibrium Quantum-Classical Conversion

### Driven Classicalization Process

External driving enhances classicalization rate:

$$\Gamma_{Q \rightarrow C}^{driven} = \Gamma_{Q \rightarrow C}^{equilibrium} \cdot (1 + \zeta \cdot F_{ext})$$

where $F_{ext}$ is the external driving intensity and $\zeta$ is the response coefficient.

Classicalization path selection probability:

$$P(path_i) \propto e^{-\beta(W_i - \Delta F_i)}$$

where $W_i$ is the work on path $i$ and $\Delta F_i$ is the free energy change.

### Quantum Feedback Control of Classicalization

Quantum feedback control can precisely regulate the classicalization process:

$$\mathcal{C}_{feedback}(\rho) = \sum_i M_i(\rho) \rho M_i^{\dagger}(\rho)$$

where $M_i(\rho)$ are state-dependent measurement operators.

Relationship between feedback gain and classicalization efficiency:

$$\eta_{C} = \eta_{C}^{(0)} \cdot (1 + G_{feedback} \cdot I_{measurement})$$

where $G_{feedback}$ is the feedback gain and $I_{measurement}$ is the measurement information amount.

## Irreversible Processes and Time Arrow

### Microscopic Reversibility Breaking

Quantum-classical conversion breaks microscopic reversibility:

$$P(x \rightarrow y) \neq P(y \rightarrow x)$$

Correlation entropy production rate:

$$\sigma_{correlation} = k_B \sum_{x,y} P(x,y) \ln\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)}$$

### Time Arrow Emergence Mechanism

The time arrow emerges from quantum-classical nonequilibrium dynamics:

$$\vec{T} = \nabla_t S$$

Time directionality measure:

$$D_T = \int dt \: \text{Tr}(\rho(t) \ln \rho(t) - \rho(-t) \ln \rho(-t))$$

For equilibrium systems $D_T = 0$, for nonequilibrium systems $D_T > 0$.

### Memory Effects and History Dependency

Nonequilibrium systems exhibit memory effects, represented as:

$$\rho(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} dt' \: K(t-t') \rho(t')$$

Memory kernel function decay characteristics:

$$K(t) \sim e^{-t/\tau_{memory}}$$

## Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem

### Quantum-Classical Fluctuation Relations

In nonequilibrium quantum-classical systems, fluctuations and dissipation satisfy generalized relations:

$$\langle \delta A(t) \delta B(0) \rangle = k_B T \cdot \chi_{AB}(t) + \Delta_{QC}(t)$$

where $\chi_{AB}(t)$ is the response function and $\Delta_{QC}(t)$ is the quantum-classical correction term.

### Fluctuation Enhancement Effect

Nonequilibrium degree enhances fluctuation intensity:

$$\langle (\delta A)^2 \rangle_{NEQ} = \langle (\delta A)^2 \rangle_{EQ} \cdot (1 + \alpha D_{NEQ})$$

Critical fluctuation scaling law:

$$\langle (\delta A)^2 \rangle \sim |T-T_c|^{-\gamma} \cdot D_{NEQ}^{\delta}$$

### Non-Gaussian Fluctuation Characteristics

Strong nonequilibrium systems produce non-Gaussian fluctuations, manifested in higher-order correlation functions:

$$\langle \delta A^4 \rangle - 3\langle \delta A^2 \rangle^2 \neq 0$$

Non-Gaussian factor can be calculated:

$$\gamma_2 = \frac{\langle \delta A^4 \rangle}{\langle \delta A^2 \rangle^2} - 3$$

## Life Systems as Nonequilibrium Quantum-Classical Structures

### Nonequilibrium Definition of Life

Life systems can be formalized as special types of nonequilibrium quantum-classical structures:

$$\Psi_{life} = \{\rho_Q, K_C, \Phi_E, \Phi_I, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}\}$$

with additions:
- $\mathcal{R}$ represents self-replication capability
- $\mathcal{A}$ represents autonomous adaptation capability

### Quantum-Classical Duality of Life Information Processing

Life information processing simultaneously utilizes quantum and classical mechanisms:

$$I_{processed} = \eta_Q I_Q + \eta_C I_C + \eta_{QC} I_{QC}$$

where $I_{QC}$ is the synergistic information at the quantum-classical interface.

Cross-scale information integration:

$$I_{scale}(s_1:s_2) = \sum_i I_i(s_1) + \sum_j I_j(s_2) + I_{integration}(s_1, s_2)$$

### Classicalization Efficiency Optimization in Life Systems

Life evolution has optimized classicalization efficiency:

$$\eta_{C,life} > \eta_{C,nonlife}$$

Biological significance of entropy production:

$$\Pi_{S,life} = \Pi_{S,maintenance} + \Pi_{S,growth} + \Pi_{S,reproduction}$$

## Nonequilibrium Explanation of Creative Processes

### Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Creative Thinking

Creative thinking processes can be modeled as nonequilibrium quantum-classical conversions:

$$\Psi_{creative} = \text{cycle}(\mathcal{Q} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{Q}')$$

1. **Quantization**: Known classical knowledge transforms into quantum possibility space
2. **Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics**: Nonequilibrium evolution of possibility space
3. **Classicalization**: New quantum possibilities classicalize into innovative knowledge

Innovation measurement metric:

$$I_{innovation} = I_{new} - I_{derivation}$$

where $I_{derivation}$ is the amount of information directly derivable from existing knowledge.

### Computational Capability of Nonequilibrium Systems

Nonequilibrium systems have enhanced computational capability:

$$C_{compute}^{NEQ} > C_{compute}^{EQ}$$

Relationship between computational complexity and nonequilibrium degree:

$$T_{compute}(n) \propto T_{EQ}(n) \cdot e^{-\gamma D_{NEQ}}$$

### Quantum-Classical Dual Nature of Artistic Creation

Formal expression of the artistic creation process:

$$A = \mathcal{C}_{artist}(\Psi_Q) + \epsilon$$

where $\mathcal{C}_{artist}$ is the artist-specific classicalization function and $\epsilon$ is the technical implementation error.

Information transfer efficiency of artwork:

$$\eta_{art} = \frac{I_{receiver}}{I_{creator}}$$

This depends on shared context and the receiver's classicalization ability.

## Nonequilibrium State Measurement and Observation Effects

### Nonequilibrium Measurement Theory

Measurement results of nonequilibrium states depend on measurement rate:

$$P(m|\rho_{NEQ}) = \text{Tr}(M_m \rho_{NEQ} M_m^{\dagger}) + \Delta P(\Gamma_{measurement}, D_{NEQ})$$

where $\Delta P$ is the nonequilibrium correction term, related to measurement rate $\Gamma_{measurement}$ and nonequilibrium degree $D_{NEQ}$.

### Measurement Back-action Enhancement

Measurement back-action is enhanced in nonequilibrium states:

$$\delta \rho_{NEQ} > \delta \rho_{EQ}$$

Relationship between measurement disturbance and nonequilibrium degree:

$$\|\delta \rho\| \propto (1 + \beta D_{NEQ}) \cdot \|\Pi_m\|$$

### Observer-Induced Phase Transitions

Strong observation can induce phase transitions in nonequilibrium systems:

$$\mu_c^{observed} = \mu_c^{unobserved} - \alpha \cdot \Gamma_{observation}$$

Observation changes the effective system temperature:

$$T_{eff}^{observed} = T_{eff}^{unobserved} \cdot (1 + \gamma \cdot \Gamma_{observation})$$

## Experimental Predictions and Verification Methods

### Observable Signals

Observable signals predicted by nonequilibrium quantum-classical theory:

1. **Nonequilibrium Noise Spectral Density**:
   $$S(\omega) \sim \omega^{-\alpha} \cdot (1 + \beta D_{NEQ})$$

2. **Thermodynamic Force-Flow Nonlinearity**:
   $$J_i = \sum_j L_{ij}X_j + \sum_{j,k} L_{ijk}X_j X_k + ...$$

3. **Quantum Coherence Time Correction**:
   $$T_2^{NEQ} = T_2^{EQ} \cdot (1 - \gamma D_{NEQ})$$

### Biological System Tests

Proposed tests for biological systems:

1. **Metabolism-Information Correlation Test**:
   $$I_{processed} \propto E_{metabolic}^{\alpha} \cdot (1 + \beta D_{NEQ})$$

2. **Quantum-Classical Conversion Efficiency Measurement**:
   $$\eta_{QC,life} - \eta_{QC,nonlife} > \Delta\eta_{threshold}$$

3. **Biological System Response to Fluctuations**:
   $$R_{bio}(\omega) \neq R_{nonbio}(\omega)$$

### Social System Predictions

Predictions for social systems as collective nonequilibrium quantum-classical structures:

1. **Relationship Between Innovation Rate and Social Nonequilibrium Degree**:
   $$r_{innovation} \propto D_{NEQ,social}^{\alpha}$$

2. **Social Phase Transition Critical Exponent Characteristics**:
   $$\chi_{social} \sim |c-c_c|^{-\gamma_{social}}$$

3. **Collective Memory Effects**:
   $$M_{collective}(t) \sim e^{-(t/\tau_{mem})^{\beta}}$$
   where $\beta < 1$ exhibits slow decay characteristics.
