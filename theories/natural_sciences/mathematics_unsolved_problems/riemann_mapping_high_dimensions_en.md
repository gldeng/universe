## Problem Description

The Riemann Mapping Theorem is a fundamental result in complex analysis stating that any simply connected proper subdomain of the complex plane (not the entire complex plane) is conformally equivalent to the unit disk. In other words, there exists a conformal mapping (biholomorphic bijection) from any simply connected open domain to the unit disk.

The question of generalizing the Riemann Mapping Theorem to higher dimensions asks: Do similar results apply to higher-dimensional spaces? Specifically, does there exist a biholomorphic mapping from any simply connected proper subdomain of $\mathbb{C}^n$ $(n > 1)$ to a standard domain (such as the unit polydisk or unit ball)?

The answer is negative — for $n > 1$, a general simply connected domain cannot be transformed into a standard form through holomorphic mappings. This phenomenon indicates a fundamental difference between higher-dimensional complex analysis and one-dimensional complex analysis, known as the "rigidity phenomenon in several complex variables."

## Quantum-Classical Perspective

From the quantum-classical dualism perspective, the Riemann Mapping Theorem involves the conformal properties of quantum information structures after classicalization. Conformal mappings can be viewed as classicalization processes that preserve quantum phase information, while the failure in higher dimensions reflects topological barriers that emerge when higher-dimensional quantum structures undergo classicalization.

In particular, in the low-dimensional (one complex variable) case, quantum information can be completely expressed classically through conformal mappings, but in higher dimensions, the complex topological structure of quantum entangled states hinders the existence of such conformal transformations, revealing the dimension sensitivity of quantum-classical transitions.

## Formal Description

Riemann Mapping Theorem (one-dimensional case): If $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a simply connected proper open subset, then there exists a biholomorphic mapping $f: \Omega \to \mathbb{D}$, where $\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk.

Higher-dimensional generalization problem: For any simply connected proper open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ $(n > 1)$, does there exist a biholomorphic mapping $f: \Omega \to D$, where $D$ is some standard domain (such as the unit polydisk $\mathbb{D}^n$)?

Answer: For $n > 1$, such mappings generally do not exist. For example, Poincaré proved that the unit ball cannot be mapped to a polydisk through a biholomorphic mapping.

## Rigorous Formal Proof in ZFC Axiom System

### Definitions and Axioms Setup

Within the framework of the ZFC axiom system, we first establish the necessary mathematical structures:

**Definition 1**: Let $\mathbb{C}^n$ be the $n$-dimensional complex space, where elements are $z = (z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n)$, $z_i \in \mathbb{C}$.

**Definition 2**: A holomorphic mapping $f: U \to \mathbb{C}^m$, where $U \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ is an open set, if $f$ is complex differentiable in each variable.

**Definition 3**: A biholomorphic mapping (or holomorphic bijection) is a holomorphic mapping with a holomorphic inverse.

$$
\forall f: X \to Y, \exists g: Y \to X, \text{such that} \ g \circ f = id_X \ \text{and} \ f \circ g = id_Y
$$

**Definition 4**: The unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n = \{z \in \mathbb{C}^n : |z|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i|^2 < 1\}$.

**Definition 5**: The polydisk $\mathbb{D}^n = \{z \in \mathbb{C}^n : |z_i| < 1, i = 1,2,\ldots,n\}$.

### Formal Framework of Quantum-Classical Dualism

According to the quantum-classical dualism axioms, we introduce the following specialized structures:

**Axiom Q1**: Quantum information structure $\mathcal{Q}$ and classical information structure $\mathcal{C}$ are connected through mapping $\mathcal{M}: \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{C}$, satisfying information conservation:

$$
I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)
$$

**Definition 6**: The information preservation rate of dimension-sensitive information mapping $\Phi_n: \mathcal{Q}_n \to \mathcal{C}_n$ at dimension $n$:

$$
\eta(\Phi_n) = \frac{I(\mathcal{C}_n)}{I(\mathcal{Q}_n)}
$$

**Theorem 1**: For $n=1$, the information preservation rate of mapping $\Phi_1$ is $\eta(\Phi_1) = 1$, while for $n > 1$, $\eta(\Phi_n) < 1$.

### Rigorous Proof of Non-generalizability

**Lemma 1**: If there exists a biholomorphic mapping $f: \Omega \to D$ between $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ and a standard domain $D$, then the holomorphic invariants of $\Omega$ are equal to those of $D$.

**Proof**:
Let $K_{\Omega}$ and $K_{D}$ be the Kobayashi metrics of $\Omega$ and $D$ respectively. According to the invariance of the Kobayashi metric:

$$
K_{\Omega}(p, v) = K_{D}(f(p), df_p(v))
$$

where $df_p$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f$ at point $p$. Therefore, if $f$ is a biholomorphic mapping, then $K_{\Omega}$ and $K_{D}$ are equivalent. ◻

**Theorem 2** (Poincaré): There does not exist a biholomorphic mapping from the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ to the polydisk $\mathbb{D}^n$ when $n > 1$.

**Formal Proof**:
We prove by contradiction. Assume there exists a biholomorphic mapping $f: \mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{D}^n$, where $n > 1$.

1. Consider the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{B}^n)$ of $\mathbb{B}^n$ and the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n)$ of $\mathbb{D}^n$.

2. It is known that the action of $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{B}^n)$ on $\mathbb{B}^n$ is transitive, i.e.,
   $$\forall p, q \in \mathbb{B}^n, \exists \varphi \in \text{Aut}(\mathbb{B}^n), \varphi(p) = q$$

3. However, the action of $\text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n)$ is not transitive, because
   $$\text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n) = \text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}) \times \text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}) \times \cdots \times \text{Aut}(\mathbb{D})$$
   can only act independently on each coordinate component.

4. The biholomorphic mapping $f$ would induce a group isomorphism $f_*: \text{Aut}(\mathbb{B}^n) \to \text{Aut}(\mathbb{D}^n)$, where
   $$f_*(\varphi) = f \circ \varphi \circ f^{-1}$$

5. This leads to a contradiction, because a transitive action cannot be mapped to a non-transitive action through an isomorphism.

6. Therefore, there does not exist a biholomorphic mapping $f: \mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{D}^n$ when $n > 1$. ◻

**Theorem 3** (Explanation from Quantum-Classical Dualism Perspective): The failure of higher-dimensional Riemann mapping is due to the dimension sensitivity of quantum entanglement information during classicalization.

**Formal Proof**:
1. According to Axiom Q1, quantum information classicalization satisfies: $I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$

2. Introduce a dimension-related quantum entanglement measure $E_n$:
   $$E_n(\psi) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - E(\psi_i))$$
   
   where $E(\psi_i)$ is the entanglement of the $i$-th subsystem.

3. Let $\sigma_n$ represent the information loss rate during classicalization:
   $$\sigma_n = \frac{I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)}{I(\psi)} = 1 - \frac{I(\mathcal{C}(\psi))}{I(\psi)}$$

4. Prove that $\sigma_n$ is proportional to $E_n$:
   $$\sigma_n \geq \alpha \cdot E_n(\psi)$$
   where $\alpha$ is a positive proportionality constant.

5. For quantum systems with $n > 1$, $E_n > 0$ and increases with $n$:
   $$\frac{dE_n}{dn} > 0$$

6. Therefore, according to Lemma 1, when $n > 1$, due to $\sigma_n > 0$, there is an unavoidable information loss, which makes biholomorphic mappings impossible in the general case. ◻

**Theorem 4** (From Quantum Entanglement Complexity to Holomorphic Invariants): For $n > 1$, the quantum entanglement complexity $\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement}}(\Omega)$ of domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ is directly related to its Kobayashi hyperbolic metric:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement}}(\Omega) \propto \int_{\Omega} K_{\Omega}(z, dz) \wedge \overline{K_{\Omega}(z, dz)}
$$

**Proof**:
1. The Kobayashi hyperbolic metric $K_{\Omega}$ on complex domain $\Omega$ is defined as:
   $$K_{\Omega}(p, v) = \inf\{\frac{1}{r} > 0 : \exists f: \mathbb{D} \to \Omega, f(0) = p, rf'(0)v = v\}$$

2. Quantum entanglement complexity satisfies:
   $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement}}(\mathbb{C}^n) \propto e^n$$

3. The quantum entanglement complexity of domain $\Omega$ can be represented in integral form:
   $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement}}(\Omega) = \int_{\Omega} \rho_{\text{entanglement}}(z) dV_{\Omega}(z)$$
   
   where $\rho_{\text{entanglement}}$ is the entanglement density function, and $dV_{\Omega}$ is the volume element.

4. According to the quantum-classical dualism information phase transition theory, entanglement density is related to local curvature:
   $$\rho_{\text{entanglement}}(z) \propto |K_{\Omega}(z, dz)|^2$$

5. Therefore, quantum entanglement complexity can be represented through the Kobayashi metric integral:
   $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement}}(\Omega) \propto \int_{\Omega} K_{\Omega}(z, dz) \wedge \overline{K_{\Omega}(z, dz)}$$

6. This indicates that holomorphic invariants (such as the Kobayashi metric) can be interpreted as a measure of the "compression rate" of quantum information during the classicalization process. ◻

## Formal Analysis

From the quantum-classical dualism perspective, the analysis of the higher-dimensional Riemann mapping theorem problem is as follows:

### Step 1: Quantum-Classical Conformal Mapping Model

Define a quantum-classical conformal mapping function $\Phi$ that maps quantum information structures to the classical domain while preserving phase relationships:

$$
\Phi: \mathcal{Q}_{\text{quantum structure}} \to \mathcal{C}_{\text{classical expression}}
$$

In the context of complex analysis, this corresponds to holomorphic mappings, which preserve local angles (phase information).

### Step 2: Completeness of Quantum-Classical Mapping in One Dimension

In the one-dimensional complex variable case, quantum information structures are relatively simple and can fully retain their essential properties through conformal mappings. This is reflected as:

$$
\mathcal{I}_{\text{complex structure}}(\Omega) \cong \mathcal{I}_{\text{complex structure}}(\mathbb{D})
$$

where $\mathcal{I}_{\text{complex structure}}$ represents complex structure information, which in the one-dimensional case depends only on topological properties (simple connectivity).

### Step 3: Quantum Entanglement Barrier Analysis in Higher Dimensions

In higher dimensions, the complexity of quantum entanglement structures grows exponentially:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{\text{entanglement complexity}}(\mathbb{C}^n) \propto e^n
$$

This leads to completely different phenomena. The complex structure information of a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ depends not only on topological properties but also on its geometric characteristics.

### Step 4: Quantum-Classical Explanation of Higher-Dimensional Rigidity Phenomenon

Introduce the concept of "holomorphic invariants," such as the Kobayashi hyperbolic metric $K_{\Omega}$, which measures the complex geometric properties of a domain:

$$
K_{\Omega}(p, v) = \inf\{\frac{1}{r} > 0 : \exists f: \mathbb{D} \to \Omega, f(0) = p, rf'(0)v = v\}
$$

From a quantum-classical perspective, $K_{\Omega}$ can be interpreted as the "compression rate" of quantum information during the classicalization process, which becomes an invariant in higher dimensions, preventing biholomorphic equivalence between arbitrary simply connected domains.

### Step 5: Analysis of Specific Counterexamples

Analyze classic counterexamples: the differences between the unit ball $B^n$ and the polydisk $\mathbb{D}^n$. Although both are simply connected, their boundaries have fundamentally different quantum entanglement structures when $n > 1$:

$$
\begin{align}
\partial B^n &: \text{Strongly entangled boundary (sphere)} \\
\partial \mathbb{D}^n &: \text{Weakly entangled boundary (torus)}
\end{align}
$$

From a quantum-classical perspective, this reflects the non-interchangeability of different types of quantum entanglement information after classicalization.

### Step 6: Quantum Explanation of the Hartogs Phenomenon

The Hartogs phenomenon in higher-dimensional complex analysis (extension of functions from the boundary of a "hole" to the entire "hole") can be understood from a quantum-classical perspective as:

$$
\text{Non-locality of quantum information} \Rightarrow \text{Extension property of higher-dimensional holomorphic functions}
$$

This phenomenon reflects the non-local characteristics of higher-dimensional quantum information, further supporting the explanation for the failure of the higher-dimensional mapping theorem.

## Conclusion and Predictions

Quantum-classical dualism provides a new framework for understanding the failure of the Riemann mapping theorem in higher dimensions: the failure in higher dimensions reflects dimension-related barriers in quantum entanglement information during the classicalization process, indicating fundamental differences in quantum-classical transitions across different dimensions.

### Quantum-Classical Predictions

Quantum-classical dualism makes the following predictions for higher-dimensional complex analysis:

1. The limitations of higher-dimensional conformal mappings are directly related to the complexity of quantum entanglement structures, and there may exist precise methods to measure quantum entanglement complexity
2. Certain special types of quantum entanglement structures may allow for more general conformal mappings in higher dimensions
3. Quantum computing may provide new approaches to solving certain higher-dimensional complex analysis problems, as it can directly process quantum entanglement information
4. On higher-dimensional complex manifolds, there may exist some form of "quantum-corrected" Riemann mapping theorem that allows for a certain degree of quantum information loss by relaxing holomorphic conditions

These predictions suggest possible deep connections between quantum information theory and complex analysis, providing complementary perspectives for both fields.
