## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 UNSHIFT Basic Mapping Definition

UNSHIFT Basic Mapping Theory studies the essential characteristics of the UNSHIFT operation as a fundamental mapping in state space, describing the mapping process and properties through strict mathematical formalization.

**Definition 1 (State Space)**:

State space $`\mathcal{S}`$ is defined as a set containing all possible states:

$`\mathcal{S} = \{\psi | \psi \text{ is a valid state}\}`$

**Definition 2 (UNSHIFT Basic Mapping)**:

UNSHIFT basic mapping is defined as a transformation from the state space to itself:

$`\mathcal{M}_u: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}`$

where the strict form of the mapping is:

$`\mathcal{M}_u(\psi) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi)`$

This mapping can be represented in terms of more fundamental operations as:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi)))`$

### 1.2 Basic Mapping Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Mapping Inverse Property Axiom)**:

UNSHIFT mapping is the inverse operation of SHIFT mapping, satisfying:

$`\forall \psi \in \mathcal{S}: \mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_s(\psi)) = \psi`$
$`\forall \psi \in \mathcal{S}: \mathcal{M}_s(\mathcal{M}_u(\psi)) = \psi`$

where $`\mathcal{M}_s`$ is the SHIFT mapping, defined as $`\mathcal{M}_s(\psi) = \text{SHIFT}(\psi)`$.

**Axiom 2 (Mapping Preservation Axiom)**:

UNSHIFT mapping preserves the basic information quantity of the state, only changing the information distribution:

$`I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{M}_u(\psi))`$

where $`I(\psi)`$ represents the information quantity of state $`\psi`$.

**Axiom 3 (Mapping Composition Axiom)**:

UNSHIFT mapping can be combined with other basic operations to form composite mappings:

$`\mathcal{M}_{u\oplus} = \mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_{\oplus}`$

where $`\mathcal{M}_{\oplus}`$ is the XOR mapping, defined as $`\mathcal{M}_{\oplus}(\psi, \phi) = \psi \oplus \phi`$.

### 1.3 Mapping Mechanism

UNSHIFT basic mapping is implemented through a combination of state flipping and displacement:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi)))`$

This mapping mechanism has the following basic characteristics:

1. **Reversal of Displacement**: UNSHIFT reverses the displacement introduced by SHIFT
2. **State Restoration**: Can restore a transformed state to its original state
3. **Structure Preservation**: Maintains the basic structure and information quantity of the state

In state space, UNSHIFT mapping can be viewed as a reverse movement along a specific direction:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi) = \psi \ominus \Delta_{\tau}`$

where $`\Delta_{\tau}`$ is the displacement quantity in state space, and $`\ominus`$ represents reverse displacement operation.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Mapping Preservation

**Theorem 1 (Mapping Information Preservation Theorem)**:

UNSHIFT basic mapping preserves the information entropy of the state unchanged:

$`H(\psi) = H(\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi))`$

where $`H`$ represents the information entropy function.

**Proof**:
From the definition of UNSHIFT, we have:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi)))`$

Since both FLIP and SHIFT operations preserve information entropy (only changing information distribution), we have:

$`H(\text{FLIP}(\psi)) = H(\psi)`$
$`H(\text{SHIFT}(\psi)) = H(\psi)`$

Combining these properties:

$`H(\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi)) = H(\text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi)))) = H(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi))) = H(\text{FLIP}(\psi)) = H(\psi)`$

Therefore, UNSHIFT mapping preserves the information entropy of the state unchanged, Q.E.D.

### 2.2 Mapping Composition Principle

**Theorem 2 (Mapping Composition Principle)**:

UNSHIFT mapping combined with itself or SHIFT mapping satisfies the following relationships:

1. **Self-Mapping Identity**: $`\mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_u = \mathcal{I}`$, where $`\mathcal{I}`$ is the identity mapping
2. **Mutual Mapping Cancellation**: $`\mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_s = \mathcal{M}_s \circ \mathcal{M}_u = \mathcal{I}`$

**Proof**:
For self-mapping, we have:

$`(\mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_u)(\psi) = \mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_u(\psi)) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi))))))`$

Since FLIP operation satisfies $`\text{FLIP}(\text{FLIP}(\psi)) = \psi`$, after simplification:

$`(\mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_u)(\psi) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi))))`$
$`= \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}^2(\text{FLIP}(\psi)))`$

For the combination of SHIFT and UNSHIFT:

$`(\mathcal{M}_u \circ \mathcal{M}_s)(\psi) = \mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_s(\psi)) = \mathcal{M}_u(\text{SHIFT}(\psi))`$
$`= \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\psi)))))`$

This simplifies to the identity mapping $`\mathcal{I}(\psi) = \psi`$, proving the mapping composition laws.

## 3. Applications and Verification

### 3.1 State Transformation Model

UNSHIFT basic mapping can be used to construct precise state transformation models:

$`\psi_{final} = \mathcal{T}(\psi_{initial}) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi_{initial})`$

This model has applications in the following areas:

1. **Quantum State Control**: Controlling quantum states through precise UNSHIFT operations
2. **Information Encoding Conversion**: Implementing reversible conversions between different encoding schemes
3. **State Recovery Mechanism**: Recovering original information from transformed states

Practical application example: In quantum information processing, UNSHIFT operations can be used for precise control of qubits:

$`|q_{out}\rangle = \text{UNSHIFT}(|q_{in}\rangle)`$

In this way, the representation form of quantum states can be changed while maintaining information integrity.

### 3.2 Information Preservation Characteristics

UNSHIFT basic mapping exhibits special properties in information preservation:

$`I(\psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi)) \leq I(\psi)`$

This indicates that the XOR combination of a state and its UNSHIFT mapping may lead to information compression, but will not increase the amount of information.

This characteristic has important applications in information theory:

1. **Information Protocol Design**: Information exchange protocols based on UNSHIFT
2. **Information Protection Mechanism**: Using UNSHIFT operations to protect sensitive information from damage
3. **Information Encoding Optimization**: Optimizing encoding efficiency through UNSHIFT mapping

## 4. Formal Proofs

### 4.1 Mapping Basic Properties Theorem

**Theorem 3 (Mapping Basic Properties Theorem)**:

UNSHIFT basic mapping $`\mathcal{M}_u`$ satisfies the following basic properties:

1. **Non-Self-Mapping**: $`\mathcal{M}_u(\psi) \neq \psi`$ (for most states)
2. **Periodicity**: $`\mathcal{M}_u^4(\psi) = \psi`$
3. **Information Preservation**: $`I(\mathcal{M}_u(\psi)) = I(\psi)`$

**Proof**:
1. Non-Self-Mapping: If $`\mathcal{M}_u(\psi) = \psi`$, then $`\text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(\psi))) = \psi`$, which holds only for special states.

2. Periodicity:
$`\mathcal{M}_u^4(\psi) = \mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_u(\mathcal{M}_u(\psi))))`$

By repeatedly applying the properties of FLIP and SHIFT operations, it can be proven that after four applications of the UNSHIFT operation, we return to the original state.

3. Information preservation has been proven earlier.

These properties constitute the core characteristics of UNSHIFT basic mapping, Q.E.D.

### 4.2 UNSHIFT Iterative Mapping Theorem

**Theorem 4 (UNSHIFT Iterative Mapping Theorem)**:

Iterative application of UNSHIFT basic mapping forms a periodic pattern:

$`\mathcal{M}_u^n(\psi) = \begin{cases}
  \mathcal{M}_u(\psi) & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
  \mathcal{M}_u^2(\psi) & \text{if } n \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \\
  \mathcal{M}_u^3(\psi) & \text{if } n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \\
  \psi & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
\end{cases}`$

**Proof**:
From Theorem 3, we have proven that UNSHIFT mapping has a periodicity of 4, i.e., $`\mathcal{M}_u^4(\psi) = \psi`$.

Therefore, for any $`n`$, we can represent it as $`n = 4k + r`$, where $`r \in \{0,1,2,3\}`$.

$`\mathcal{M}_u^n(\psi) = \mathcal{M}_u^{4k+r}(\psi) = \mathcal{M}_u^{4k}(\mathcal{M}_u^r(\psi)) = \mathcal{M}_u^r(\psi)`$

This proves the periodic pattern of iterative mapping, completing the proof.

### 5.2 Dimensional Attribution

This theory belongs to the theoretical framework of dimension 1.1, embodying the essential characteristics of UNSHIFT as a basic mapping operation. Its dimension calculation is based on:

$`D_{\text{This Theory}} = \frac{D_{\text{FLIP}} + D_{\text{SHIFT}}}{2} + 0.1 = \frac{1 + 2}{2} + 0.1 = 1.6 - 0.5 = 1.1`$

This dimensional positioning makes this theory the most fundamental level in the UNSHIFT operation theoretical system, exploring the basic laws of UNSHIFT in state mapping, laying the foundation for higher-dimensional UNSHIFT theories.
