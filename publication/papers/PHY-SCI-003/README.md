# Information Ontology: Rewriting the Foundations of Physics

**Paper ID:** PHY-SCI-003  
**Target Journal:** Science  
**Current Status:** READY  
**Last Updated:** April 20, 2025

## Project Overview

This research paper presents a comprehensive framework that establishes information as the fundamental substrate of reality. Using primitive information operations (XOR and SHIFT), we derive quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics from a common foundation, resolving long-standing paradoxes and generating testable predictions.

## Key Contributions

1. Establishes information as the ontological primitive of physical reality
2. Resolves the quantum measurement problem through information-based interpretation
3. Derives spacetime as an emergent structure from information relationships
4. Unifies quantum mechanics and relativity through common information principles
5. Provides specific experimental predictions that differ from conventional theories

## Experimental Predictions

1. **Quantum Interference Modification**: P(x) = |ψ(x)|² + α·d²|ψ(x)|²/dx²
2. **Gravitational Wave Phase Shift**: Δϕ = (G·ħ/c⁵)·M·ω·ln(d/r_s)
3. **Black Hole Radiation Spectrum**: S(ω) = (ħω³/4π²c²(e^(ħω/k_BT) - 1))·(1 + αħ/Mc²)

## Next Steps

1. Conduct comprehensive review of all materials
2. Validate all mathematical derivations for consistency
3. Run final simulation tests to confirm predictions
4. Prepare presentation materials for potential inquiries
5. Finalize submission package according to Science guidelines
