## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Duality Axiom)**

The primitive dual system $`\mathcal{D}_1`$ consists of two complementary states $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$, existing in a one-dimensional state space:

$`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} \subset \mathcal{S}_1`$

where $`\mathcal{S}_1`$ is a one-dimensional state space.

**Axiom 2 (Complementary Symmetry Axiom)**

The two states $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ in the primitive dual system form a strict complementary symmetry relationship:

$`\alpha \neq \beta`$ and $`\alpha \oplus \beta = \emptyset`$

where $`\emptyset`$ represents the empty state or nothingness, and $`\oplus`$ is the primitive composition operation.

**Axiom 3 (Ergodic Evolution Axiom)**

The primitive dual system exhibits strict binary ergodicity in its temporal evolution:

$`\alpha^t \mapsto \beta^{t+1} \mapsto \alpha^{t+2}`$

$`\beta^t \mapsto \alpha^{t+1} \mapsto \beta^{t+2}`$

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Duality

The essence of primitive duality is to constitute the most fundamental relationship of opposition and unity in the universe. The dual state system $`\mathcal{D}_1`$ can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} = \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^*\}`$

where $`\mathcal{P}_0`$ is the primitive point, and $`\mathcal{P}_0^*`$ is the dual state of the primitive point.

Primitive duality creates the first non-trivial state space, making state transitions possible. In this space, information is generated through the distinction between two states, forming the most basic unit of informationâ€”the bit.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Dual System

The primitive dual system has the following basic properties:

1. **Binary Completeness**: The dual system is completely constituted by two states $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$, with no third state

2. **Absolute Mutual Exclusivity**: The two states are mutually exclusive with no overlap:
   $`\alpha \cap \beta = \emptyset`$

3. **Complementary Completeness**: The two states are complementary and completely cover the state space:
   $`\alpha \cup \beta = \mathcal{S}_1`$

4. **Transformation Symmetry**: The system supports a single non-trivial transformation, namely state exchange:
   $`\mathcal{T}: \alpha \leftrightarrow \beta`$

5. **Period-2 Property**: The system dynamics exhibit a strict period-2 property:
   $`\mathcal{T}^2 = I`$, where $`I`$ is the identity transformation

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Primitive Dual System

The evolution of the primitive dual system follows the simplest alternation rule:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{D}_1}: s^t \mapsto \bar{s}^{t+1}`$

where $`s \in \{\alpha, \beta\}`$, and $`\bar{s}`$ represents the complementary state of $`s`$.

The state sequence of the system forms a strict alternating pattern:

$`(\alpha, \beta, \alpha, \beta, ...)`$ or $`(\beta, \alpha, \beta, \alpha, ...)`$

This simplest evolution pattern is the foundation of all complex dynamical systems, achieving the first transition from the static primitive point to a dynamic system.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Dual States

From the axioms of the primitive dual system, the following properties can be directly derived:

1. **State Space Dimensionality**: The system's state space is truly two-dimensional:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 |\mathcal{D}_1| = \log_2 2 = 1`$

2. **Transformation Group Order-2**: The symmetry transformation group of the system is a second-order cyclic group:
   $`G_{\mathcal{D}_1} = \{I, \mathcal{T}\} \cong Z_2`$

3. **Invariant Existence**: There exist global invariants of the system:
   $`|\mathcal{D}_1| = 2`$, meaning the total number of states in the system remains constant

4. **Ergodic Completeness**: The system traverses all possible states in its evolution:
   $`\{s^t, s^{t+1}, s^{t+2}, ...\} = \{\alpha, \beta\}, \forall s \in \{\alpha, \beta\}`$

### 2.2 Information Properties of Dual States

The primitive dual system has fundamental properties from an information theory perspective:

1. **Information Capacity**: The maximum information content of the system is 1 bit:
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 |\mathcal{D}_1| = 1 \text{ bit}`$

2. **Information Entropy**: The maximum entropy of the system under uniform distribution assumption is:
   $`H_{\max}(\mathcal{D}_1) = -\sum_{i} \frac{1}{2} \log_2 \frac{1}{2} = 1 \text{ bit}`$

3. **Information Distinguishability**: The minimal information unit that the system can distinguish is 1 bit:
   $`\Delta I_{\min} = H(\alpha|\beta) = H(\beta|\alpha) = 1 \text{ bit}`$

4. **Information Evolution Periodicity**: Information states exhibit strict periodic changes:
   $`I(s^t) \neq I(s^{t+1})` and $`I(s^t) = I(s^{t+2})`$, where $`I(s)`$ represents the information content of state $`s`$

### 2.3 Symmetries of Dual System

The primitive dual system exhibits multiple symmetries:

1. **Discrete Time Reversal Symmetry**:
   The system is invariant under time reversal operations: if $`\alpha \mapsto \beta`$, then $`\mathcal{T}^{-1}(\beta) = \alpha`$

2. **State Exchange Symmetry**:
   Exchanging state labels does not change the physical behavior of the system: $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} \equiv \{\beta, \alpha\}`$

3. **Spacetime Symmetry**:
   Time evolution and state exchange have equivalence: $`\mathcal{E}_1 \cong \mathcal{T}`$

4. **Absolute Binary Law**:
   Any composite state is strictly decomposed into binary base states: $`\forall \gamma \in \mathcal{S}_1, \gamma = c_\alpha \alpha + c_\beta \beta`$, where $`c_\alpha, c_\beta \in \{0,1\}`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Primitive Point to Dual States

The primitive dual system evolves from the primitive point:

1. **Symmetry Breaking Mechanism**:
   The primitive point differentiates into dual states through symmetry breaking:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \stackrel{\text{symmetry breaking}}{\longrightarrow} \{\alpha, \beta\}`$

2. **Self-Differentiation**:
   Internal potential energy release in the primitive point leads to self-differentiation:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \mapsto \mathcal{P}_0 \oplus \mathcal{P}_0^* = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$

3. **Perturbation Amplification**:
   Tiny quantum fluctuations are amplified to form binary structure:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 + \delta \mapsto \alpha, \mathcal{P}_0 - \delta \mapsto \beta`$

4. **Information Emergence**:
   Zero-information primitive point achieves information emergence through differentiation:
   $`I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \mapsto I(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \text{ bit}`$

### 3.2 Extension from Dual States to XOR Systems

The primitive dual system naturally extends to XOR operation systems:

1. **State Space Extension**:
   Binary states extend to multi-dimensional binary states:
   $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} \mapsto \mathcal{D}_n = \{s_1 s_2 ... s_n | s_i \in \{\alpha, \beta\}\}`$

2. **Operation Complexification**:
   Single exchange operation extends to XOR combination operations:
   $`\mathcal{T}: \alpha \leftrightarrow \beta \mapsto \text{XOR}_{v}(s) = s \oplus v, v \in \mathcal{D}_n`$

3. **Bit Correlation**:
   Single bit extends to multi-bit correlation:
   $`I(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \text{ bit} \mapsto I(\mathcal{D}_n) = n \text{ bits}`$

4. **Dimensional Upgrade**:
   Dimension 1 extends to dimension 2:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \mapsto \dim(\text{XOR}) = 2`$

### 3.3 Relationship Between Dual States and FLIP Operation

The primitive dual system has a strict correspondence relationship with the FLIP operation:

1. **FLIP Mapping**:
   FLIP operation can be defined as a mapping between dual states:
   $`\text{FLIP}: \mathcal{D}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_1, \text{FLIP}(\alpha) = \beta, \text{FLIP}(\beta) = \alpha`$

2. **Identity**:
   The dual state exchange transformation $`\mathcal{T}`$ is completely equivalent to the FLIP operation:
   $`\mathcal{T}(s) \equiv \text{FLIP}(s), \forall s \in \mathcal{D}_1`$

3. **Second-Order Identity**:
   Two FLIP operations are equivalent to the identity transformation:
   $`\text{FLIP}^2(s) = s, \forall s \in \mathcal{D}_1`$

4. **Information Flipping**:
   FLIP achieves complete information flipping:
   $`I(\text{FLIP}(s)) = \neg I(s), \forall s \in \mathcal{D}_1`$, where $`\neg`$ represents logical negation

## 4. Application and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The primitive duality theory generates the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Universal Existence of Binary Basic Structures**:
   The most fundamental structures in nature should exhibit binary characteristics

2. **Bit as Basic Information Unit**:
   The smallest unit of information should be 1 bit, corresponding to binary distinction

3. **Widespread Existence of Period-2 Dynamic Systems**:
   A large number of natural systems following period-2 dynamics should exist

4. **Widespread Existence of Second-Order Symmetry**:
   $`Z_2`$ symmetry should appear widely as the most common symmetry type in nature

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The primitive duality theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Theoretical Consistency Verification**:
   Verify the compatibility of the binary system model with information theory and quantum mechanics

2. **Computer Simulation**:
   Construct cellular automata based on binary state alternation and study their emergent properties

3. **Physical System Mapping**:
   Study spin-1/2 systems, quantum bits, ferromagnetic order parameters, and other binary physical systems

4. **Information Encoding Verification**:
   Verify that binary representation is the optimal basic encoding for computation and information processing

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Unique Transformation of Primitive Dual System**

In the primitive dual system $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$, apart from the identity transformation, the only possible transformation is the state exchange transformation $`\mathcal{T}`$.

*Proof*:
Let $`f: \mathcal{D}_1 \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_1`$ be any transformation on $`\mathcal{D}_1`$.
Since $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$, there are $`2^2 = 4`$ possible mappings.
These mappings are:
1. $`f_1(\alpha) = \alpha, f_1(\beta) = \beta`$: identity transformation $`I`$
2. $`f_2(\alpha) = \beta, f_2(\beta) = \alpha`$: exchange transformation $`\mathcal{T}`$
3. $`f_3(\alpha) = \alpha, f_3(\beta) = \alpha`$: constant mapping to $`\alpha`$
4. $`f_4(\alpha) = \beta, f_4(\beta) = \beta`$: constant mapping to $`\beta`$

According to Axioms 1 and 2, the system must maintain its binary nature. Constant mappings $`f_3`$ and $`f_4`$ degrade the system to a single state, violating Axiom 1, thus they are not valid transformations for the system.

Therefore, the only possible transformations on $`\mathcal{D}_1`$ are $`I`$ and $`\mathcal{T}`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Capacity of Dual State System**

The maximum information capacity of the primitive dual system $`\mathcal{D}_1`$ is 1 bit.

*Proof*:
According to information theory, the information capacity of a system is defined as:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 |\mathcal{D}_1|`$

By Axiom 1, $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$, so $`|\mathcal{D}_1| = 2`$.

Therefore, $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 2 = 1 \text{ bit}`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Ergodicity of Primitive Dual System**

The primitive dual system is ergodic in its evolution process, meaning that starting from any initial state, the system can visit all possible states in the state space.

*Proof*:
According to Axiom 3, the system's evolution rule is:
$`\alpha^t \mapsto \beta^{t+1} \mapsto \alpha^{t+2}`$
$`\beta^t \mapsto \alpha^{t+1} \mapsto \beta^{t+2}`$

Therefore, regardless of whether the initial state is $`\alpha`$ or $`\beta`$, after one time step, the system necessarily visits the other state.
That is, for any initial state $`s^0 \in \{\alpha, \beta\}`$, there exists a finite time $`T`$ such that:
$`\{s^0, s^1, s^2, ..., s^T\} = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$

In fact, $`T = 1`$ is sufficient to achieve complete traversal. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Primitive Dual System and Cosmic Ontology**

The primitive dual system $`\mathcal{D}_1`$ is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. In the primitive dual system:
   - FLIP operation is equivalent to the state exchange transformation $`\mathcal{T}`$
   - XOR operation degenerates to FLIP operation on binary states
   - SHIFT operation can be viewed as an extension based on binary states

2. The recursive self-referential structure of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   For the dual system, this is manifested as the cyclic self-reference of states:
   $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\} = \{\mathcal{T}(\beta), \mathcal{T}(\alpha)\}`$

3. The binary unity axiom of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   Has a direct correspondence relationship with the binary structure of the primitive dual system $`\mathcal{D}_1 = \{\alpha, \beta\}`$

4. The primitive dual system can be viewed as a simplified form of the cosmic ontology initial state equation, satisfying:
   $`\mathcal{D}_1^{t+1} = \mathcal{D}_1^t \oplus \text{FLIP}(\mathcal{D}_1^t)`$

Therefore, the primitive dual system is a direct manifestation of cosmic ontology in the low-dimensional case, and the two theories are completely compatible. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The primitive duality theory is positioned as a dimension 1 theory in the cosmic ontology theoretical spectrum for the following reasons:

1. **State Space Dimension**: $`\dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 |\mathcal{D}_1| = \log_2 2 = 1`$

2. **Operation Complexity**: The system supports 1 basic operation (state exchange/FLIP)
   - Dimension 0 theory (primitive point) has no effective operations
   - Dimension 2 theory (XOR) supports multiple combination operations

3. **Information Capacity**: $`I(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1 \text{ bit}`$, corresponding exactly to dimension 1

4. **Theory Dependency Relationship**: Primitive point â†’ Primitive duality â†’ XOR, manifesting a clear dimensional progression relationship
