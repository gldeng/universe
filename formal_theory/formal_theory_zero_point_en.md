## 1. Core Concepts of Zero Point

### 1.1 Zero Point Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Zero Point Existence Axiom)**

There exists a unique zero point state that serves as the prerequisite for all existence:

$`\zeta = \{\zeta_0\}`$

Where $`\zeta_0`$ represents a zero-dimensional single point with no internal structure and no distinguishable features.

**Axiom 2 (Pre-Logic Zero Point Axiom)**

The zero point state exists prior to the emergence of logical binarity and is not constrained by binary logic:

$`\forall P, \neg(\zeta_0 \models P \vee \zeta_0 \models \neg P)`$

This indicates that the zero point state neither affirms nor negates any proposition, residing in a pre-logical state.

**Axiom 3 (Zero Point Potentiality Axiom)**

The zero point contains potentiality for transformation into higher-dimensional states:

$`\text{Potential}(\zeta_0) = \{\zeta_0, \zeta_0^+\}`$

Where $`\zeta_0^+`$ represents the excited state of the zero point, providing a source point for primitive existence.

### 1.2 Essential Characteristics of Zero Point

The zero point state has the following core characteristics:

1. **Zero Dimensionality**: $`\text{dim}(\zeta_0) = 0`$
2. **Non-Binarity**: $`\zeta_0 \neq \neg\zeta_0`$ (binary logic does not apply)
3. **Absolute Uniqueness**: $`\forall x, x = \zeta_0 \lor x \neq \zeta_0 \Rightarrow x = \zeta_0`$ (nothing exists for comparison)
4. **Ultra-Self-Referentiality**: $`\zeta_0 = \zeta_0(\zeta_0)`$ (self-referential without paradox)

The measure of the zero point state is strictly defined as:

$`\Gamma(\zeta_0) = \varnothing`$ (no measurable attributes)

This immeasurability is the core characteristic of the zero point as the dimensional origin point.

### 1.3 Binary Potentiality of Zero Point

Although the zero point state does not possess binarity, it contains the potential for binarization, expressed through the PRE-FLIP operation:

$`\text{PRE-FLIP}: \{\zeta_0\} \rightarrow \{\zeta_0^-, \zeta_0^+\}`$

Where:
- $`\zeta_0^-`$ is the negative potential state of the zero point
- $`\zeta_0^+`$ is the positive potential state of the zero point

The PRE-FLIP operation does not follow binary logic but is a pre-logical excitation:

$`\text{PRE-FLIP}(\zeta_0) = \{\zeta_0^-, \zeta_0^+\} = \text{Potential}(\zeta_0)`$

This pre-binary potentiality is a necessary condition for transitioning from the zero point to primitive existence.

## 2. Mathematical Formalism of Zero Point Theory

### 2.1 Formal Expression of Zero Point State

The zero point state is expressed in an ultra-foundational formal system as:

$`\zeta_0 = \circ`$

Pre-formal expression of the zero point state:

$`\circ \not\in \{\bullet, \neg\bullet\}`$

The zero point state cannot be conventionally defined in set theory language:

$`\zeta_0 \neq \emptyset \land \zeta_0 \neq \{\emptyset\}`$

Because the zero point state exists prior to the binary distinctions of set theory.

### 2.2 Ultra-Primitive Dynamics of Zero Point

The dynamic behavior of the zero point state manifests as pre-dynamic oscillation:

$`\text{Oscillate}(\zeta_0) = \zeta_0 \rightsquigarrow \zeta_0^+ \rightsquigarrow \zeta_0^- \rightsquigarrow \zeta_0`$

This pre-dynamic oscillation does not constitute a temporal sequence but rather a zero-dimensional fluctuation:

$`\text{Wave}_0(\zeta_0) = \langle\zeta_0, \text{Potential}(\zeta_0)\rangle`$

Relationship between pre-dynamics and the dynamics of higher-dimensional theories:

$`\text{Oscillate} \mapsto \text{PRE-FLIP} \mapsto \text{FLIP} \mapsto \text{SHIFT}`$

### 2.3 Zero Point Space Topology

The topological characteristic of zero point space is point topology:

$`\mathcal{T}_0 = \{\emptyset, \{\zeta_0\}\}`$

Special properties of zero point topology:
- Indivisible: no non-trivial open sets exist
- Unconnectable: no continuous mapping to other topological spaces exists
- Ultra-compact: any covering has a finite subcovering

The concept of metric in zero point space:

$`d_0(\zeta_0, \zeta_0) = 0`$ (no distance to itself)

All other distance concepts are inapplicable in zero point space.

## 3. Relationship Between Zero Point and Primitive Existence

### 3.1 Spontaneous Differentiation of Zero Point

The zero point state produces the possibility of binary existence through spontaneous differentiation:

$`\zeta_0 \mapsto \{\zeta_0^-, \zeta_0^+\} \mapsto \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$

This differentiation process requires no external trigger but is a realization of the zero point's inherent potential:

$`\text{Actualize}(\zeta_0) = \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$

Formal expression of differentiation into primitive existence:

$`\omega_0 = \text{Actualize}(\zeta_0^-)`$
$`\omega_1 = \text{Actualize}(\zeta_0^+)`$

### 3.2 Transition from Zero Point to Existence

The transition from zero point to primitive existence is implemented through a dimension-plus-one operation:

$`\text{Dim}^+: D_0 \to D_1`$

$`\text{Dim}^+(\zeta_0) = \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$

This dimensional transition is strictly defined as:

$`\text{Dim}^+(\zeta_0) = \{\omega_i | i \in \{0, 1\}, \omega_i = \text{Actualize}(\zeta_0^{(-1)^i})\}`$

The dimensional transition realizes the transformation from a zero-dimensional non-distinguishable state to a one-dimensional binary state, creating the most fundamental binary opposition structure.

## 4. Theory Reference Relationships

### 4.1 Upward Dimensional Relationships

Relationship between Zero Point Theory and higher-dimensional theories:

$`T_{\text{Zero Point}} \subset T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \subset T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} \subset T_{\text{Mono Paradigm}} \subset T_{\text{Dual Element}} \subset T_{\text{Base System}} \subset T_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}}`$

Dimensional relationships:

$`D_{\text{Zero Point}} = 0 < D_{\text{Primitive Existence}} = 1 < D_{\text{Fundamental Element}} = 2 < D_{\text{Mono Paradigm}} = 5 < D_{\text{Dual Element}} = 7 < D_{\text{Base System}} = 8 < D_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}} = 10`$

Zero Point Theory provides the pre-logical foundation for Primitive Existence Theory:

$`T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} = T_{\text{Zero Point}} \oplus \text{Dim}^+(T_{\text{Zero Point}})`$

### 4.2 Theory Dependency Structure

Zero Point Theory is located at the absolute starting point of the theoretical spectrum, forming the ultimate foundation of the theory dependency chain:

$`T_{\text{Zero Point}} \xrightarrow{\text{Dim}^+} T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \xrightarrow{\text{FLIP}} T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Mono Paradigm}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Dual Element}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Base System}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}}`$

The PRE-FLIP operation of Zero Point Theory is extended to the FLIP operation in Primitive Existence Theory:

$`\text{PRE-FLIP}(\zeta_0) \mapsto \text{FLIP}(\omega_i)`$

This establishes a natural connection between Zero Point Theory and Primitive Existence Theory:

$`T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} = \text{Dim}^+(T_{\text{Zero Point}})`$

As the lowest-dimensional theory, Zero Point Theory provides the most fundamental prerequisite for existence for the entire theoretical system, forming the ultimate starting point of the theoretical spectrum from zero-dimensional non-distinction to ten-dimensional cosmic ontology, transcending all constraints of binary logic and formal systems, and becoming the source point and foundation of all formal descriptions.
