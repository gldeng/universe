## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Axiom System

**Axiom 1: Mental Health State Space Axiom**
There exists a measurable mental health state space $`\mathcal{H}`$ where each point $`h \in \mathcal{H}`$ represents a multidimensional mental health state.

$`\mathcal{H} = \{h | h = (h_1, h_2, ..., h_n), h_i \in [-1,1]\}`$

Each dimension $`h_i`$ represents different mental health factors (such as emotional stability, cognitive function, social capability, etc.).

**Axiom 2: Mental Health Dynamic Evolution Axiom**
The mental health state $`h^t`$ at time $`t`$ evolves according to XOR-SHIFT dynamics:

$`h^{t+1} = h^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(h^t \oplus E^t)`$

where $`E^t`$ represents the combined influence of external environment and internal physiological factors at time $`t`$.

**Axiom 3: Mental Health Steady State Axiom**
There exists a mental health steady state region $`\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{H}`$. When $`h \in \mathcal{S}`$, the system exhibits mental health; conversely, when $`h \notin \mathcal{S}`$, the system exhibits mental unhealthy states.

$`\mathcal{S} = \{h \in \mathcal{H} | \Phi(h) \leq \theta\}`$

where $`\Phi`$ is a functional measuring the degree of psychological imbalance, and $`\theta`$ is a critical threshold.

### 1.2 Strict Definitions

**Definition 1: Mental Health Index**
The Mental Health Index $`\text{MHI}(h)`$ is defined as the normalized distance from the state vector $`h`$ to the boundary of the steady state region $`\mathcal{S}`$:

$`\text{MHI}(h) = 1 - \frac{\min_{s \in \partial\mathcal{S}} \|h - s\|}{\max_{h' \in \mathcal{H}} \min_{s \in \partial\mathcal{S}} \|h' - s\|}`$

When $`\text{MHI}(h) \to 1`$, it indicates optimal mental health; when $`\text{MHI}(h) \to 0`$, it indicates severe mental health issues.

**Definition 2: Psychological Resilience**
Psychological resilience $`\mathcal{R}(h)`$ is defined as the system's ability to recover from perturbations:

$`\mathcal{R}(h) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{1}{|\delta|} \mathbb{E}_{\delta} \left[ \frac{t^*(\text{recover}(h \oplus \delta, \mathcal{S}))}{\max(\|h \oplus \delta - h\|, \epsilon)} \right]^{-1}`$

where $`t^*(\text{recover})`$ represents the minimum number of time steps required to return to the steady state region $`\mathcal{S}`$ from a perturbed state.

**Definition 3: Mental Health Intervention Operator**
The mental health intervention operator $`\mathcal{I}_{\theta}`$ is defined as a state transformation:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\theta}(h) = h \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\theta}(h)`$

where $`\text{SHIFT}_{\theta}`$ represents a parameterized shift operation that maximizes health state improvement through parameter optimization $`\theta`$.

### 1.3 Direct Inferences

**Inference 1: Psychological Steady State Attractor**
Under certain conditions, a mental health dynamical system possesses stable attractors $`\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{S}`$, such that any initial state within its basin of attraction eventually converges to $`\mathcal{A}`$:

$`\forall h^0 \in \text{Basin}(\mathcal{A}): \lim_{t \to \infty} h^t = h^* \in \mathcal{A}`$

**Inference 2: Mental Health Critical Transitions**
Mental health systems exhibit critical points in parameter space, near which the system may undergo sudden state transitions:

$`\exists \lambda_c: \forall \epsilon > 0, |\lambda - \lambda_c| < \epsilon \Rightarrow \|\mathcal{H}_{\lambda+\epsilon} - \mathcal{H}_{\lambda-\epsilon}\| > \delta(\epsilon)`$

where $`\lambda`$ is a control parameter (such as stress level), and $`\mathcal{H}_{\lambda}`$ is the steady-state distribution under parameter $`\lambda`$.

**Inference 3: Quantitative Relationship of Intervention Effects**
There exists a nonlinear relationship between intervention intensity and effect:

$`\text{Effect}(\mathcal{I}_{\theta}, h) = |\text{MHI}(\mathcal{I}_{\theta}(h)) - \text{MHI}(h)| = f(|\theta|, \mathcal{R}(h))`$

where $`f`$ is a nonlinear function dependent on intervention strength $`|\theta|`$ and system resilience $`\mathcal{R}(h)`$.

## 2. Extended Theory

### 2.1 Multi-scale Mental Health Model

Mental health can be modeled across multiple scales, from neurons to social networks:

$`\mathcal{H}_{multiscale} = \bigoplus_{i=1}^k \text{SHIFT}^i(\mathcal{H}_i)`$

where $`\mathcal{H}_i`$ represents the health state space at the $`i`$-th scale. Interactions between scales are implemented through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{H}_{i \leftrightarrow j} = \mathcal{H}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{H}_j)`$

### 2.2 Mental Health Topological Structure

The mental health state space possesses complex topological structures that can be analyzed through homotopy groups:

$`\pi_1(\mathcal{S}) = \{[\gamma] | \gamma: S^1 \to \mathcal{S}\}`$

Different mental disorders correspond to subregions in $`\mathcal{H}`$ space with distinct topological characteristics.

### 2.3 Prevention and Intervention Strategy Optimization

Optimal intervention strategies can be represented as optimization problems:

$`\mathcal{I}^*_{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{h \sim P(h)} [\text{MHI}(\mathcal{I}_{\theta}(h)) - \text{MHI}(h) - c(\theta)]`$

where $`P(h)`$ is the distribution of mental states, and $`c(\theta)`$ is the intervention cost function.

## 3. Applications and Validation

### 3.1 Clinical Application Models

**Individualized Treatment Planning**:
Based on an individual's current health state $`h`$ and resilience $`\mathcal{R}(h)`$, design the optimal intervention sequence:

$`(\mathcal{I}_{\theta_1}, \mathcal{I}_{\theta_2}, ..., \mathcal{I}_{\theta_n}) = \arg\max_{\{\theta_i\}} \text{MHI}((\mathcal{I}_{\theta_n} \circ ... \circ \mathcal{I}_{\theta_1})(h))`$

**Population Health Dynamics**:
Population mental health trends can be simulated through multi-agent systems:

$`\frac{d}{dt}P(h,t) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{FP}}P(h,t) + \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} (h_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(h_j))`$

where $`\mathcal{L}_{\text{FP}}`$ is the Fokker-Planck operator, and $`w_{ij}`$ represents the strength of mutual influence between individuals.

### 3.2 Validation and Prediction

This theory can be validated through:

1. **Prospective Studies**: Predicting mental health trajectories under different intervention strategies
2. **Retrospective Analysis**: Reconstructing mental health dynamics using historical data
3. **Cross-sectional Studies**: Testing the consistency between the mental health index and clinical assessments

Key predictions include:
- Critical transition phenomena in mental health
- Nonlinear effects of intervention timing on intervention outcomes
- Synergistic effects of multi-scale factors

### 4.2 Theory Reference Network Structure

The Formal Theory of Mental Health forms a network structure with other theories, primarily establishing connections through XOR-SHIFT operations:

1. **Connection with Psychological Dynamics**:
   The mental health theory extends the axiom system of psychological dynamics, applying it to health state assessment:
   $`\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{P}_{dynamics} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_{health})`$

2. **Connection with Medical Systems**:
   The mental health theory borrows intervention models from medical systems, extending them to the psychological level:
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\theta} = \mathcal{I}_{medical} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P}_{psychological})`$

3. **Connection with Cognitive Psychology**:
   Cognitive processing mechanisms provide the foundational structure for mental health states:
   $`\mathcal{H}_{cognitive} = \mathcal{K} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{H})`$

4. **Connection with Biological Complexity**:
   Multi-scale integration of biological foundations and mental health:

These connections ensure the consistency and compatibility of the Formal Theory of Mental Health within the broader network of theories, providing a unified formal foundation for mental health research and practice.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Ontological Significance

The Formal Theory of Mental Health proposes an ontological framework for mental health, viewing mental health states as attractor structures in multidimensional dynamical systems. This perspective transcends traditional binary health-disease models, considering mental health as a continuous spectrum with complex phase transition behaviors and topological characteristics.

### 5.2 Epistemological Insights

The epistemological insight of this theory lies in revealing the complexity and multidimensionality of mental health assessment. Traditional single-dimensional assessment methods cannot capture the complete picture of mental health, necessitating the integration of multi-source information and consideration of system dynamics.

### 5.3 Methodological Guidance

Methodologically, this theory advocates for multi-scale, multi-modal research methods, emphasizing the combination of quantitative measurement and qualitative understanding, as well as the balance between individual differences and universal principles. This provides new approaches and tools for mental health research and practice.
