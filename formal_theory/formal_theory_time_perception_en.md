**English Version | [中文版](formal_theory_time_perception.md)**

> This theory is based on [Core Theory](../core_en.md) v11.1 and [Quantum-Classical Dualism Formal Theory](../formal_theory_core_en.md) v28.0

## Core Theory Overview

Time Perception Theory studies the quantum-classical duality of conscious time perception, explaining the variability of subjective time experience and its neural foundations. This theory proposes that time perception is a special manifestation of the quantum-classical interface, where the quantum domain provides time's non-locality and elasticity, while the classical domain provides time's sequentiality and consistency. The dynamic balance between them determines the subjective experience of time.

## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Formal Definition of Time Perception

Time perception $`\mathcal{T}_P`$ can be formally defined as:

$`
\mathcal{T}_P = (\mathcal{T}_Q, \mathcal{T}_C, \mathcal{I}_T, \mathcal{O})
`$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{T}_Q`$ is the quantum domain representation of time (non-locality, simultaneity, elasticity)
- $`\mathcal{T}_C`$ is the classical domain representation of time (locality, sequentiality, fixed rate)
- $`\mathcal{I}_T`$ is the time quantum-classical interface
- $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer state

### Core Time Perception Axioms

**Axiom 1: Time Duality**
Time simultaneously possesses both quantum and classical essential properties:

$`
\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_Q \diamond \mathcal{T}_C
`$

Where $`\diamond`$ represents the quantum-classical connection operation.

**Axiom 2: Subjective Time Relativity**
The subjective time flow rate depends on the observer's degree of classicalization:

$`
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}\right)
`$

Where $`\tau`$ is subjective time, $`t`$ is objective time, and $`\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}`$ is the ratio of the observer's classicalization to quantization.

**Axiom 3: Time Perception Conservation**
Within a given psychological state space, the total measure of subjective time perception is conserved:

$`
\int_{\Omega} \frac{d\tau}{dt} d\mu(\mathcal{O}) = \text{constant}
`$

Where $`\Omega`$ is the observer state space, and $`\mu`$ is the measure on that space.

**Axiom 4: Time Perception Emergence**
Time perception emerges from the quantum-classical conversion process in the neural system:

$`
\mathcal{T}_P = \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{N}_Q, \mathcal{N}_C, \mathcal{I}_N)
`$

Where $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the emergence function, $`\mathcal{N}_Q`$ represents the quantum components of the neural system, $`\mathcal{N}_C`$ represents the classical components of the neural system, and $`\mathcal{I}_N`$ is the quantum-classical interface in the neural system.

## Core Theory Content

### Quantum State Representation of Time

The quantum representation of time can be described as a special quantum state:

$`
|\Psi_T\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |t_i\rangle
`$

Where $`|t_i\rangle`$ are time point basis vectors, and $`\alpha_i`$ are complex amplitudes.

This representation has the following characteristics:
1. **Temporal Superposition**: Simultaneous existence of multiple time points
2. **Temporal Non-locality**: Quantum correlations between distant time points
3. **Temporal Coherence**: Phase relationships between time points

The entropy of a quantum time state can be defined as:

$`
S(\rho_T) = -\text{Tr}(\rho_T \ln \rho_T)
`$

Where $`\rho_T = |\Psi_T\rangle\langle\Psi_T|`$ is the density matrix of the quantum time state.

### Classical Representation of Time

The classical representation of time can be described as a deterministic trajectory:

$`
T_C = \{(t_i, X_i) | i \in \mathbb{Z}\}
`$

Where $`t_i`$ are sequentially arranged time points, and $`X_i`$ are the system states at the corresponding time points.

This representation has the following characteristics:
1. **Unidirectionality**: Time flows in only one direction
2. **Continuity**: Continuous transition between time points
3. **Measurability**: Time intervals can be precisely measured

The entropy of a classical time series can be defined as:

$`
S(T_C) = -\sum_i p(t_i) \log_2 p(t_i)
`$

Where $`p(t_i)`$ is the probability of observing a specific event at time point $`t_i`$.

### Neural Dynamics of Time Perception

The neural dynamics equation for time perception:

$`
\frac{d|\Psi_N(t)\rangle}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}_N(t)|\Psi_N(t)\rangle + \mathcal{D}(\rho_N)
`$

Where $`\hat{H}_N(t)`$ is the time-dependent neural system Hamiltonian, and $`\mathcal{D}(\rho_N)`$ is the decoherence term.

Time encoding in the neural system involves two processes:
1. **Quantum Encoding**: Time encoding through quantum coherence of neuron groups
2. **Classical Encoding**: Time encoding through neural discharge sequences and frequencies

The conversion between the two encodings can be represented as:

$`
\mathcal{C}_T(\rho_N) = \sum_i P_i^T \rho_N P_i^T
`$

Where $`P_i^T`$ are time-related projection operators.

### Subjective Time Elasticity Mechanism

The elasticity (stretching and compression) of subjective time can be described as:

$`
\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \alpha\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}} + \beta\frac{I_{proc}}{I_{inp}} + \gamma S_{states}
`$

Where:
- $`\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}`$ is the classicalization-quantization ratio of the observer
- $`\frac{I_{proc}}{I_{inp}}`$ is the ratio of information processing to input
- $`S_{states}`$ is the state transition entropy
- $`\alpha`$, $`\beta`$, $`\gamma`$ are weight coefficients

Limit conditions for subjective time elasticity:

$`
\lim_{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}} \to 0} \frac{d\tau}{dt} \to 0 \quad \text{(time standstill)}
`$

$`
\lim_{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}} \to 0} \frac{d\tau}{dt} \to \infty \quad \text{(time acceleration)}
`$

### Time Interface Dynamics

The interface dynamics equation for time perception:

$`
\frac{d\mathcal{I}_T}{dt} = \alpha_T \nabla^2 \mathcal{I}_T + \beta_T(\mathcal{I}_c - \mathcal{I}_T)(\mathcal{I}_T - \mathcal{I}_0) + \gamma_T\xi_T(t) + \delta_T A(t)
`$

Where:
- $`\alpha_T`$ is the time interface diffusion coefficient
- $`\beta_T`$ is the time interface bistable parameter
- $`\gamma_T`$ is the noise coupling coefficient
- $`\delta_T`$ is the attention coupling coefficient
- $`\xi_T(t)`$ is time-related quantum noise
- $`A(t)`$ is the attention function

Time interface oscillation frequency:

$`
f_{\mathcal{I}_T} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta_T}{\alpha_T}}|\mathcal{I}_c - \mathcal{I}_0| \cdot \Phi(A)
`$

Where $`\Phi(A)`$ is the attention modulation function.

### Entanglement Model of Time Perception

Quantum entanglement representation of time perception:

$`
|\Psi_{TP}\rangle = \sum_{i,j} \gamma_{ij} |t_i\rangle \otimes |s_j\rangle
`$

Where $`|t_i\rangle`$ are time basis vectors, and $`|s_j\rangle`$ are perception state basis vectors.

Time-perception entanglement degree:

$`
E(|\Psi_{TP}\rangle) = S(\rho_T) = S(\rho_P)
`$

Where $`\rho_T = \text{Tr}_P(|\Psi_{TP}\rangle\langle\Psi_{TP}|)`$ and $`\rho_P = \text{Tr}_T(|\Psi_{TP}\rangle\langle\Psi_{TP}|)`$.

Bell inequalities for time-perception:

$`
|\langle \mathcal{B}_{TP} \rangle| \leq 2 \quad \text{(classical domain)}
`$

$`
|\langle \mathcal{B}_{TP} \rangle| \leq 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{(quantum domain)}
`$

## Application Analysis

### Special Time Perception States

**Flow Experience**:
Flow state can be modeled as a special stability point of the time interface:

$`
\mathcal{I}_T^{flow} = \{p | \nabla^2 \mathcal{I}_T(p) = 0, \nabla \mathcal{I}_T(p) = 0, \lambda_{min}(\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{I}_T))(p) > 0\}
`$

Where $`\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{I}_T)`$ is the Hessian matrix of $`\mathcal{I}_T`$ at point $`p`$.

Time compression in flow experience:

$`
\frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{flow} \ll \frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{normal}
`$

**Deep Meditation State**:
Meditation state can be represented as a maximization of quantum time:

$`
\frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}|_{meditation} \gg \frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}|_{normal}
`$

Degree of time quantization and entropy change in meditation state:

$`
\Delta S(\rho_T)|_{meditation} \ll \Delta S(\rho_T)|_{normal}
`$

### Time Perception in Psychopathology

**Time Perception in Depression**:
The time interface equation in depressive state:

$`
\frac{d\mathcal{I}_T^{dep}}{dt} = \alpha_T^{dep} \nabla^2 \mathcal{I}_T^{dep} + \beta_T^{dep}(\mathcal{I}_c - \mathcal{I}_T^{dep})(\mathcal{I}_T^{dep} - \mathcal{I}_0) + \gamma_T^{dep}\xi_T(t)
`$

Where $`\alpha_T^{dep} \ll \alpha_T^{normal}`$ (interface diffusion slows down).

Time dilation effect in depression:

$`
\frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{depression} \gg \frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{normal}
`$

**Time Perception in Schizophrenia**:
Quantum time representation in schizophrenic state:

$`
|\Psi_T^{sch}\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i^{sch} |t_i\rangle, \quad \text{with} \quad \text{Coh}(|\Psi_T^{sch}\rangle) \ll \text{Coh}(|\Psi_T^{normal}\rangle)
`$

Where $`\text{Coh}(|\Psi\rangle)`$ is the quantum coherence measure.

Temporal discontinuity in schizophrenia:

$`
\text{Cont}(T_C^{sch}) \ll \text{Cont}(T_C^{normal})
`$

Where $`\text{Cont}(T_C)`$ is the continuity measure of the classical time series.

### Developmental Evolution of Time Perception

Characteristics of children's time perception compared to adults:

$`
\frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}|_{child} > \frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}|_{adult}
`$

Time perception equation in the developmental process:

$`
\frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}(t) = \frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}(0) \cdot e^{-\lambda_{dev} \cdot t} + \frac{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}(\infty) \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda_{dev} \cdot t})
`$

Where $`\lambda_{dev}`$ is the development rate parameter.

Relationship between aging and subjective time acceleration:

$`
\frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{age} = \frac{d\tau}{dt}|_{0} \cdot \left(\frac{t_{total}}{t_{total} + t}\right)
`$

Where $`t_{total}`$ is the total life experience, and $`t`$ is the current age.

## Relationships with Other Branch Theories

### Connection with Quantum Consciousness Theory

Time perception is a special manifestation of quantum consciousness:

$`
\mathcal{T}_P \subset \mathcal{C}_{consciousness}
`$

Special position of time perception in quantum consciousness:

$`
\hat{H}_{consciousness} = \hat{H}_T + \hat{H}_{other} + \hat{V}_{T-other}
`$

Where $`\hat{H}_T`$ is the time perception Hamiltonian, $`\hat{H}_{other}`$ is the Hamiltonian of other consciousness components, and $`\hat{V}_{T-other}`$ is the interaction term.

### Connection with Interface Theory

The time interface is a special form of the general interface:

$`
\mathcal{I}_T \subset \mathcal{I}
`$

Dynamic relationship between time interface and general interface:

$`
\frac{d\mathcal{I}_T}{dt} = \mathcal{F}_T\left(\frac{d\mathcal{I}}{dt}\right)
`$

Where $`\mathcal{F}_T`$ is the time specialization function.

### Connection with Observer Theory

Relationship between observer dimension and time perception:

$`
D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{1}{\frac{d\tau}{dt}}
`$

Observer time perception dimension:

$`
D_{\mathcal{O}}^T = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}^T}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}^T}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{time.perception}}{S_{time.entropy}+\epsilon}
`$
