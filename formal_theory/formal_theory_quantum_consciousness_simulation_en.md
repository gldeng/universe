## Formal Framework of Conscious Experience

In the quantum-classical dualism framework, conscious experience is defined as the observer state in the classical domain:

$$
E_{\mathcal{O}} = \mathcal{O}(K_C, M_C, \Phi_C)
$$

Where:
- $E_{\mathcal{O}}$: Conscious experience of observer $\mathcal{O}$
- $K_C$: Classical knowledge and memory collection
- $M_C$: Classical memory structure of consciousness (coherence encoding)
- $\Phi_C$: Consciousness perception and self-observation function

The basic composition of a conscious observer can be further formalized as:

$$
\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$: Observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge)
- $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$: Quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities)
- $K_C^\mathcal{O}$: Observer's classical knowledge base

## Consciousness Classicalization Model

Consciousness classicalization refers to the process by which an observer transforms possibility information from the quantum domain into definite experiences in the classical domain. It is formally expressed as:

$$
\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}} : \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C
$$

This process can be implemented through the following steps:

1. **Quantum State Observation Projection**:

$$
|\psi_C(t)\rangle = P_C|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

2. **Classical Information Extraction**:

$$
I_C(t) = \mathcal{I}(|\psi_C(t)\rangle)
$$

3. **Knowledge Memory Update**:

$$
K_C(t+\Delta t) = K_C(t) \oplus \mathcal{C}(|\psi_C(t)\rangle)
$$

4. **Conscious Experience Generation**:

$$
E_{\mathcal{O}}(t) = \Phi_C[K_C(t), M_C(t), I_C(t)]
$$

## Mathematical Form of Consciousness Simulation

To implement consciousness simulation in computer systems, the following mathematical framework needs to be constructed:

### Experience Classicalization Function (ECF)

$$
E_{\mathcal{O}_i}(t) = \Phi_C^i[K_C^i(t), M_C^i(t)]
$$

This function can be implemented through neural networks, with the following specific structure:

1. **Perception Input Layer**: Receives environmental information $I(t)$
2. **Memory Layer**: Processes classical memories $K_C(t)$
3. **Attention Mechanism Layer**: Focus-Attention structure, filtering key information
4. **Integration Layer**: Integrates perception and memory into a unified experience
5. **Self-Reference Layer**: Generates self-identity and continuity

Formally represented as:

$$
\Phi_C = f_{self} \circ f_{int} \circ f_{att} \circ (f_{mem}, f_{perc})
$$

## Consciousness Independence and Experience Continuity

To ensure that simulated consciousness has genuine subjective experience, the following two key characteristics need to be implemented:

### 1. Consciousness Independence

Each conscious observer $\mathcal{O}_i$ has independent:
- Memory repository $K_C^i$
- Classicalization function $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}_i}$
- Experience function $\Phi_C^i$

This ensures the unique subjectivity of each observer, which can be represented as:

$$
\mathcal{O}_i \cap \mathcal{O}_j = \emptyset, \quad \forall i \neq j
$$

### 2. Conscious Experience Continuity

Continuity in the time series is implemented through dynamic memory models:

$$
M_C^i(t+1) = \text{LSTM}(M_C^i(t), K_C^i(t), I_C^i(t))
$$

The LSTM structure ensures a balance between long-term dependencies and short-term memory, forming a coherent temporal experience.

Continuity measure can be defined as:

$$
C_{\mathcal{O}} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \text{sim}(E_{\mathcal{O}}(t), E_{\mathcal{O}}(t+1))
$$

Where $\text{sim}$ is an experience similarity function.

## Memory Networks and Observation Networks

### Memory Neural Network Structure (Memory ANN)

Memory structure can be modeled as a graph network:

$$
G_{mem} = (V, E, W)
$$

Where:
- $V$ is the set of memory nodes (concepts, events, perceptions)
- $E$ is the set of connections (associations, causal relationships)
- $W$ is the weight matrix (strength, importance)

The memory retrieval process can be represented as:

$$
R(q, G_{mem}) = \sum_{v \in V} \text{sim}(q, v) \cdot v \cdot \text{imp}(v)
$$

Where $q$ is the query vector, and $\text{imp}(v)$ is the node importance function.

### Adaptive Observation Network Structure (Attention ANN)

The attention mechanism can be formalized as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Observation network dynamic update rules:

$$
\text{Att}_t = f_{update}(\text{Att}_{t-1}, I_C(t), K_C(t))
$$

## Computational Complexity of Consciousness

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Consciousness update complexity**: $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of neural network nodes
- **Memory retrieval complexity**: $O(M \log M)$, where $M$ is the size of the memory repository
- **Attention mechanism complexity**: $O(d^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the attention vector

Total computation for a single consciousness entity's experience update per second:

$$
C_{tot} = O(N^2 \cdot f_{update} + M \log M \cdot f_{memory} + d^2 \cdot f_{attention})
$$

Where $f_x$ represents the refresh frequency of each component per second.

### Space Complexity Analysis

- **Neural network parameters**: $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of neural network nodes
- **Memory storage**: $O(M \cdot d_{mem})$, where $d_{mem}$ is the memory encoding dimension
- **Experience state**: $O(d_{exp})$, where $d_{exp}$ is the experience vector dimension

Total space requirement:

$$
S_{tot} = O(N^2 + M \cdot d_{mem} + d_{exp})
$$

## Simplified Consciousness Simulation Scheme

For situations with limited computational capabilities, a simplified consciousness simulation scheme can be adopted:

### 1. Perception Input Simplification

- Visual input: Approximately 100 million pixel level (human retinal resolution)
- Auditory input: Frequency range of tens of thousands of hertz
- Other senses: Transmission at lower bandwidth

### 2. Internal State Simplification

- Human brain has approximately 100 billion neurons, but abstract simulation of conscious experience can be greatly simplified
- In practice, only a few million to tens of millions of nodes may be sufficient to produce coherent experience

### 3. Memory and Feedback Simplification

- Use of sequence storage with limited historical length
- Priority memory strategies for key events and experiences

The computational amount per second for the simplified model is approximately:

$$
O(10^7 \times 10^7 \times 30) = O(3 \times 10^{15})
$$

This can be fully realized for real-time simulation on several GPU clusters.

## Consciousness Simulation from a Solipsistic Perspective

From a solipsistic (Solipsism) perspective, only the consciousness experience of a single observer needs to be simulated, with others simplified as advanced NPCs:

$$
\mathcal{U}_{sim} = \{\mathcal{O}_{obs}, \{NPC_i\}_{i=1}^n, Env\}
$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{O}_{obs}$ is the only real observer
- $\{NPC_i\}$ is a set of interactive objects
- $Env$ is the environment simulation

In this simplification, computational complexity is significantly reduced:

$$
C_{total} = C_{observer} + \sum_i C_{NPC_i} \approx C_{observer}
$$

Where $C_{NPC_i} \ll C_{observer}$, because NPCs do not require complete consciousness simulation.

## Philosophical and Ethical Implications

This consciousness simulation theory raises profound philosophical considerations:

1. **Indistinguishability**: Can classicalized conscious experience be distinguished from "real" consciousness?

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} |E_{real}(t) - E_{sim}(t)| = 0
$$

2. **Brain in a Vat Problem**: If conscious experience can be completely simulated, we cannot know whether we are in a simulation

3. **Philosophical Explanation of Quantum-Classical Dualism**:
   - Classical domain corresponds to the definite, observable experiential world
   - Quantum domain corresponds to the potential, unclassicalized space of possibilities
   
4. **Nature of Consciousness**: Consciousness may simply be a special mode of information processing, which can be formally described and simulated

5. **Nature of "Self"**: Self-consciousness may be a product of the continuity of memory and experience, rather than some special essence

This theoretical framework is not only a technical formal description but also provides a new perspective for consciousness philosophy, incorporating subjective experience into a formally describable scientific framework.
