## 1. Core Definitions

### 1.1 Formal Definition of Cyclical Dynamics

Cyclical dynamics is the study of periodic evolutionary structures in state space generated by UNSHIFT and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{C}: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega`$

Where:
- $`\Omega`$ is the system state space
- $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the dynamical mapping, composed of combinations of UNSHIFT and SHIFT operations

The general form of system evolution is:

$`x_{t+1} = \mathcal{C}(x_t) = \text{UNSHIFT}(x_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x_t))`$

The core characteristic of cyclical dynamics is the periodic recurrence of states:

$`\exists p > 0, \forall x \in \Omega: \mathcal{C}^p(x) = x`$

Where $`p`$ is the cycle period.

### 1.2 UNSHIFT Cyclical Mapping

The formal definition of UNSHIFT cyclical mapping is:

$`\Phi_C: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega`$
$`\Phi_C(x) = \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$

In two-dimensional state space, this mapping can be simplified to:

$`\Phi_C(x) = x \oplus (\text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus 1)`$

UNSHIFT cyclical mapping has the following basic properties:

1. **Finiteness**: In finite state spaces, all trajectories are periodic
2. **Invertibility**: $`\Phi_C^{-1}`$ exists and is a specific combination of SHIFT and UNSHIFT
3. **Metric Preservation**: $`d(\Phi_C(x), \Phi_C(y)) = d(x, y)`$, where $`d`$ is an appropriately defined distance function

## 2. Theoretical Formulas

### 2.1 Cycle Periods and Invariants

The cycle period $`P(x)`$ of a system is defined as the minimum number of iterations required for state $`x`$ to first return:

$`P(x) = \min\{p > 0 | \mathcal{C}^p(x) = x\}`$

A cyclic invariant $`I(x)`$ is defined as a quantity that remains constant during the cyclic process:

$`I(\mathcal{C}(x)) = I(x), \forall x \in \Omega`$

For two-dimensional UNSHIFT cyclic systems, there exists a basic invariant:

$`I(x) = |x| \oplus |\text{SHIFT}(x)|`$

Where $`|x|`$ represents the Hamming weight of state $`x`$ (the number of 1s in its binary representation).

### 2.2 Cyclical Diversity Measure

The cyclical diversity measure $`D_C`$ is defined as the total number of different cyclic structures in the system:

$`D_C = |\{[x]_C | x \in \Omega\}|`$

Where $`[x]_C = \{y \in \Omega | \exists k \geq 0: y = \mathcal{C}^k(x)\}`$ represents the cyclic orbit of $`x`$.

For two-dimensional UNSHIFT cyclic systems, the diversity measure can be calculated as:

$`D_C = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \phi(i) \cdot |\{x \in \Omega | P(x) = i\}|/i`$

Where $`\phi(i)`$ is the Euler function, representing the number of positive integers less than or equal to $`i`$ and coprime to $`i`$.

## 3. Basic Theorems

### 3.1 Periodic Structure Theorem

**Theorem**: In two-dimensional UNSHIFT cyclic systems, all state cycle periods take only the form $`2^k`$, where $`k`$ is a non-negative integer.

**Proof**:
Consider the cyclic mapping $`\mathcal{C}(x) = \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$.

For any $`x \in \Omega`$, applying $`\mathcal{C}`$ twice:
$`\mathcal{C}^2(x) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{C}(x)) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\mathcal{C}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{C}(x)))`$

Through the properties of UNSHIFT and SHIFT operations, it can be proven that:
$`\mathcal{C}^{2^k}(x) = x`$

Moreover, if $`p`$ is the period of $`x`$, then $`p = 2^k`$, where $`k`$ is the smallest non-negative integer such that $`\mathcal{C}^{2^k}(x) = x`$.

This indicates that all state cycle periods are in the form of powers of 2.

### 3.2 Cycle Preservation Theorem

**Theorem**: In UNSHIFT cyclic systems, states $`x`$ and $`\text{UNSHIFT}(x)`$ have the same cyclic structure but are half a cycle out of phase.

**Proof**:
Consider state $`x`$ with cycle period $`P(x)`$. For state $`y = \text{UNSHIFT}(x)`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{C}^{P(x)/2}(y) = \mathcal{C}^{P(x)/2}(\text{UNSHIFT}(x))`$

Through the definition of cyclic mapping and the properties of UNSHIFT, it can be proven that:
$`\mathcal{C}^{P(x)/2}(y) = x`$

Therefore $`\mathcal{C}^{P(x)}(y) = y`$, indicating that $`y`$ has the same cycle period as $`x`$, but is positioned symmetrically opposite to $`x`$ in the cycle.

## 4. Theoretical Applications

### 4.1 Phase Space Structure Analysis

The UNSHIFT cyclical dynamics theory can be used to analyze the structure of system phase space:

$`\Omega = \bigcup_{i=1}^{m} \mathcal{B}_i`$

Where $`\mathcal{B}_i`$ is a cycle basin, defined as the set of states with the same cycle period.

For two-dimensional systems, the distribution of cycle basins satisfies:

$`|\mathcal{B}_i| = 2^i \cdot c_i`$

Where $`c_i`$ is a constant related to the system structure.

This structural analysis is crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of systems.

### 4.2 State Evolution Prediction

Cyclical dynamics theory allows for precise prediction of future system states:

$`x_{t+n} = \mathcal{C}^n(x_t) = \mathcal{C}^{n \mod P(x_t)}(x_t)`$

For an initial state $`x_0`$, the state after $`t`$ iterations can be represented as:

$`x_t = \mathcal{C}^{t \mod P(x_0)}(x_0)`$

This predictive capability is valuable for long-term planning and control of complex systems.
