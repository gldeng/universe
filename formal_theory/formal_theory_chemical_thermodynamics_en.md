## Core Theory Overview

Chemical Thermodynamics and Dualism applies the quantum-classical dualism framework to thermodynamic processes, revealing the quantum-classical dual nature behind thermodynamic phenomena. This theory proposes that macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena similarly follow a quantum-classical dual structure, where entropy growth is the inevitable result of classicalization from quantum states, while energy conservation is the necessary manifestation of information redistribution during quantum-classical conversion processes. The theory establishes a unified bridge from microscopic quantum uncertainty to macroscopic thermodynamic determinism, providing a deeper foundational explanation for chemical thermodynamics.

## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Formal Definition of Thermodynamic Systems

A thermodynamic system $\mathcal{T}$ can be formally defined as:

$$\mathcal{T} = (\mathcal{T}_Q, \mathcal{T}_C, \mathcal{I}_T, \mathcal{E})$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{T}_Q$ is the quantum domain component of the thermodynamic system (microscopic particle superposition states, quantum fluctuations)
- $\mathcal{T}_C$ is the classical domain component of the thermodynamic system (macroscopic state variables, measurable properties)
- $\mathcal{I}_T$ is the thermodynamic quantum-classical interface
- $\mathcal{E}$ is the environment

### Core Thermodynamic Axioms

**Axiom 1: Thermodynamic Duality**  
Complete thermodynamic systems simultaneously possess quantum and classical fundamental domains:

$$\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_Q \diamond \mathcal{T}_C$$

Where $\diamond$ represents the quantum-classical thermodynamic connection operation.

**Axiom 2: Microscopic State Superposition Principle**  
Thermodynamic systems exist at the microscopic level in superposition states of multiple energy states:

$$|\Psi_T\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |E_i\rangle$$

Where $|E_i\rangle$ is the energy eigenstate, and $\alpha_i$ is the complex amplitude.

**Axiom 3: Thermodynamic Classicalization Principle**  
Macroscopic thermodynamic quantities are the result of classicalization of microscopic quantum states:

$$\mathcal{O}_T: |\Psi_T\rangle \rightarrow O_C$$

Where $\mathcal{O}_T$ is the thermodynamic observation operator, and $O_C$ is the classical observable.

**Axiom 4: Information-Entropy Duality Principle**  
The information and entropy of thermodynamic systems satisfy a conservation relationship:

$$I_T + S_T = \text{constant}$$

Where $I_T$ is the structured information of the system, and $S_T$ is the entropy of the system.

## Quantum-Classical Dualistic Explanation of Thermodynamic Laws

### Dualistic Explanation of Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Thermal equilibrium can be understood as a stable state of the quantum-classical interface:

$$\mathcal{I}_T^A \approx \mathcal{I}_T^B \approx \mathcal{I}_T^C \iff T_A = T_B = T_C$$

Where $\mathcal{I}_T^X$ represents the quantum-classical interface state of system X, and $T_X$ is the temperature of system X.

Formal expression of temperature as an interface parameter:

$$T \propto \left|\frac{\partial\mathcal{I}_T}{\partial S}\right|^{-1}$$

### Dualistic Explanation of First Law of Thermodynamics

Energy conservation represented as information conservation between quantum and classical domains:

$$dU = \delta Q + \delta W$$

Corresponding to:

$$d(I_Q + I_C) = \delta I_{Q\to C} + \delta I_{C\to Q}$$

Where $I_Q$ is quantum domain information, $I_C$ is classical domain information, $\delta I_{Q\to C}$ is the quantum→classical information flow corresponding to heat, and $\delta I_{C\to Q}$ is the classical→quantum information flow corresponding to work.

### Dualistic Explanation of Second Law of Thermodynamics

The principle of entropy increase is the inevitable result of quantum-classical classicalization processes:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} \geq 0$$

Corresponding to:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}(\rho)}{dt} \geq 0$$

Where $\mathcal{C}(\rho)$ is the measure of classicalization of the system state.

The driving force for entropy increase comes from decoherence at the quantum-classical interface:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = k_B \text{Tr}\left(\mathcal{D}(\rho)\ln\rho\right)$$

Where $\mathcal{D}(\rho)$ is the environment-induced decoherence superoperator.

### Dualistic Explanation of Third Law of Thermodynamics

Absolute zero corresponds to the minimum entropy of the quantum-classical interface:

$$\lim_{T\to 0} S = S_0 \approx k_B\ln g_0$$

Where $g_0$ is the degeneracy of the ground state.

A perfect crystal from a quantum-classical perspective is the ideal case where the quantum-classical interface is completely determined:

$$\mathcal{I}_T(T\to 0) \to \mathcal{I}_T^{min}$$

## Quantum-Classical Phase Transition Theory

### Quantum-Classical Interface Model of Phase Transitions

Phase transitions can be described as sudden changes in the quantum-classical interface:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{I}_T}{dt} = \alpha_T \nabla^2 \mathcal{I}_T + \beta_T f(\mathcal{I}_T,T) + \gamma_T \xi(t)$$

Where $f(\mathcal{I}_T,T)$ is the interface potential function, which at the critical point satisfies:

$$\left.\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial \mathcal{I}_T^2}\right|_{T=T_c} = 0$$

### Quantum Distinction Between First-Order and Second-Order Phase Transitions

First-order phase transitions manifest as discontinuous changes in the interface function:

$$\Delta \mathcal{I}_T \neq 0 \text{ at } T = T_c$$

Accompanied by a quantum-classical explanation of latent heat:

$$L = T_c \Delta S = T_c \Delta(\mathcal{C}(\rho)-\mathcal{Q}(\rho))$$

Where $\mathcal{C}(\rho)$ is the classicalization measure, and $\mathcal{Q}(\rho)$ is the quantization measure.

Second-order phase transitions manifest as continuous interface functions with discontinuous derivatives:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{I}_T}{dT} \text{ discontinuous at } T = T_c$$

### Critical Phenomena and Scaling Laws

Quantum-classical interface behavior near the critical point follows scaling laws:

$$\mathcal{I}_T - \mathcal{I}_{T_c} \propto |T-T_c|^\beta$$

Where $\beta$ is the critical exponent.

Quantum-classical expression of correlation length:

$$\xi \propto |T-T_c|^{-\nu}$$

Where $\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent.

### Classical Manifestation of Quantum Phase Transitions

The manifestation of quantum phase transitions in the classical domain:

$$\langle O_C \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \hat{O}) \propto |g-g_c|^\gamma$$

Where $g$ is the control parameter of the quantum Hamiltonian, and $g_c$ is the critical point.

Quantum-classical mapping relationship:

$$\beta_{quantum} = \frac{\nu_{quantum} d}{2-\eta_{quantum}}$$

Where $d$ is the system dimension, and $\eta$ is the anomalous dimension.

## Unification of Thermodynamics and Information Theory

### Equivalence of Information Entropy and Thermodynamic Entropy

Formal correspondence between Boltzmann entropy and Shannon entropy:

$$S_{Boltzmann} = k_B \ln \Omega \iff S_{Shannon} = -\sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

Unified quantum-classical entropy expression:

$$S_{unified} = -k_B \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)$$

### Information Conversion and Thermodynamic Cycles

Thermodynamic cost of information erasure:

$$\Delta Q \geq k_B T \ln(2) \cdot \Delta I$$

Corresponding to quantum-classical conversion:

$$\Delta Q \propto T \cdot \Delta \mathcal{C}(\rho)$$

### Quantum Foundation of Maximum Entropy Principle

Under given constraints, classicalization reaches the maximum entropy state:

$$\rho_{eq} = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta\hat{H}}$$

This is the most stable configuration of the quantum-classical interface:

$$\delta \mathcal{I}_T = 0 \text{ at equilibrium}$$

### Unification of Landauer Information and Fisher Information

Unified information measures in the quantum-classical framework:

$$\mathcal{I}_{Fisher} = \text{Tr}\left(\rho\left[\frac{\partial \ln \rho}{\partial \theta}\right]^2\right)$$

Relationship with thermodynamic quantities:

$$\mathcal{I}_{Fisher} \propto \frac{C_V}{k_B T^2}$$

Where $C_V$ is the heat capacity.

## Entropy Evolution in Complex Chemical Systems

### Open Systems Far From Equilibrium

Entropy balance in systems far from equilibrium:

$$\frac{dS_{total}}{dt} = \frac{dS_{int}}{dt} + \frac{dS_{ext}}{dt} \geq 0$$

Where $\frac{dS_{int}}{dt} < 0$ may occur, but total entropy still increases.

Quantum-classical formulation:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{total}}{dt} = \frac{d\mathcal{C}_{int}}{dt} + \frac{d\mathcal{C}_{ext}}{dt} \geq 0$$

### Formation of Dissipative Structures

### Entropy Control Mechanisms in Biological Systems

Quantum-classical mechanisms for maintaining low entropy in biological systems:

$$\dot{I}_{bio} = -\dot{S}_{bio} + \text{constant}$$

### Chemical Oscillations and Chaos
