## What is Cosmic Ontology Popular Theory?

Cosmic Ontology is a theoretical system built on two simple operations—XOR and SHIFT—attempting to explain all mysteries of the universe from an information-essence perspective. Here we've collected versions written in accessible language so anyone can understand these profound concepts.

Each article has two versions:
- **Popular Version**: The simplified version you're reading, explained in everyday language
- **Formal Version**: The professional version containing complete mathematical formulas and rigorous derivations

## Why Use Everyday Language?

The core ideas of Cosmic Ontology are actually very simple and elegant, but are obscured by technical terminology and mathematical symbols. These popular versions attempt to return to fundamental ideas, making these revolutionary concepts accessible to anyone.

True scientific breakthroughs should be expressible in simple language—if they can't be, they might not be true breakthroughs.

## How to Use These Documents

1. **Start with topics that interest you**: Choose the questions you're most curious about
2. **Progress gradually**: You can start with low-dimensional theories and gradually understand higher dimensions
3. **Cross-reference**: Theories have intrinsic connections and complement each other
4. **Formal reference**: When you need more rigorous proof, check the corresponding formal theory
