## Formal Theory Definition

Black Hole Information Boundary Theory describes the event horizon as a special boundary condition for cosmic information operations, and provides a mathematically formalized model for quantum information preservation and transformation. This theory combines the basic XOR-SHIFT operations of Cosmic Ontology to propose a new approach to resolving the black hole information paradox.

### Symbol System

- $\mathcal{H}$: Black hole event horizon
- $\mathcal{I}(\Sigma)$: Information content in region $\Sigma$
- $\mathcal{B}_H$: Black hole information boundary operator
- $S_{BH}$: Black hole entropy
- $\rho_H$: Event horizon information density matrix
- $\mathscr{T}$: Information transformation operator
- $\Omega_Q$: Quantum domain
- $\Omega_C$: Classical domain

### Axiom Set

**Axiom 1 (Information Boundary Axiom)**:
The black hole event horizon $\mathcal{H}$ constitutes an information boundary, preventing internal and external information from directly exchanging through classical channels. Formally:

$\mathcal{B}_H(\mathcal{I}_{in}, \mathcal{I}_{out}) = \mathcal{I}_{in} \oplus \mathcal{I}_{out} \neq 0$

where $\mathcal{I}_{in}$ and $\mathcal{I}_{out}$ are the information sets inside and outside the black hole, respectively.

**Axiom 2 (Area-Entropy Relationship Axiom)**:
The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its event horizon area and characterizes its information capacity:

$S_{BH} = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4G\hbar}$

where $A$ is the event horizon area, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $\hbar$ is the Planck constant.

**Axiom 3 (Information SHIFT Axiom)**:
When matter or energy crosses the event horizon, the associated information undergoes a SHIFT operation, transforming into state information of the event horizon:

$\mathcal{I}_{\text{fallen}} \rightarrow \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{I}_{\text{fallen}}) = \mathcal{I}_{\text{horizon}}$

**Axiom 4 (Information XOR Preservation Axiom)**:
Black hole information is not lost but preserved between different forms through XOR operations:

$\mathcal{I}_{\text{initial}} = \mathcal{I}_{\text{Hawking}} \oplus \mathcal{I}_{\text{residual}}$

where $\mathcal{I}_{\text{Hawking}}$ is the information carried by Hawking radiation, and $\mathcal{I}_{\text{residual}}$ is the information remaining in the black hole state.

## Inference System

### Theorem 1: Event Horizon Information Encoding Theorem

The information encoded in a black hole event horizon can be described by information field theory, with the state vector of the field defined as:

$|\Psi_{\mathcal{H}}\rangle = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |\phi_i\rangle$

where $|\phi_i\rangle$ are the basis vectors of the microscopic states of the horizon, and $\alpha_i$ are complex amplitudes.

**Proof**:
From Axiom 2, the black hole entropy $S_{BH}$ corresponds to the logarithm of possible microscopic states, so the number of states is $e^{S_{BH}}$. Each microscopic state can be represented as an orthogonal basis vector $|\phi_i\rangle$, and the total state must be a linear combination of these basis vectors. The state amplitudes $\alpha_i$ can be calculated from quantum field theory of the horizon. Due to the quantum superposition of different matter states before the horizon leading to quantum superposition of the horizon, the event horizon can encode holographic information. $\square$

### Theorem 2: Information Preservation Transformation Theorem

There exists a unitary operator $\mathscr{U}$ such that all information falling into a black hole can eventually be recovered through Hawking radiation:

$\mathscr{U}(|\Psi_{\text{in}}\rangle \otimes |0_{\text{rad}}\rangle) = |0_{\text{in}}\rangle \otimes |\Psi_{\text{rad}}\rangle$

where $|\Psi_{\text{in}}\rangle$ is the initial state of the infalling information, $|0_{\text{rad}}\rangle$ is the vacuum state of the initial radiation field, $|0_{\text{in}}\rangle$ is the vacuum state of the black hole interior, and $|\Psi_{\text{rad}}\rangle$ is the final radiation field state.

**Proof**:
From Axiom 4, applying the XOR operation, there is a one-to-one mapping between infalling information and the combination of Hawking radiation information and residual black hole information. When the black hole completely evaporates, the residual black hole information is zero, thus $\mathcal{I}_{\text{initial}} = \mathcal{I}_{\text{Hawking}}$. This is equivalent to the existence of an information-preserving unitary transformation $\mathscr{U}$ that maps the initial state to the final radiation state. From the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, time evolution must be unitary, so such a transformation must exist. $\square$

### Theorem 3: Horizon Information Flow Theorem

The information flow on the event horizon follows:

$\frac{d\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{H}}}{dt} = \Phi_{\text{in}} - \Phi_{\text{out}}$

where $\Phi_{\text{in}}$ is the rate of information flowing into the event horizon, and $\Phi_{\text{out}}$ is the rate of information flowing out through Hawking radiation.

**Proof**:
Applying Axioms 1 and 3, the event horizon as an information boundary has its information content affected by inflow and outflow processes. Generalizing from the first law of thermodynamics, the change in a system's information equals inflow minus outflow. For a black hole, information inflow comes from infalling matter, and outflow comes from Hawking radiation. When $\Phi_{\text{in}} = \Phi_{\text{out}}$, the black hole is in information equilibrium. $\square$

## Theory Applications

### 1. Solution to the Black Hole Information Paradox

This theory provides a pathway to resolving the black hole information paradox, indicating that information is not lost during black hole evaporation but is re-encoded through XOR-SHIFT operations on the event horizon and ultimately returns to the universe via Hawking radiation. This solution is compatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics and the principle of information conservation.

### 2. Black Hole Computation Model

Based on the information boundary theory, a theoretical model of black holes as special computational devices can be constructed, where the event horizon performs complex quantum XOR-SHIFT operations, achieving non-local information processing.

### 3. Spacetime Singularity Information Behavior

Provides mathematical tools for describing information behavior near spacetime singularities, particularly how information is reorganized under strong gravitational fields and how this reorganization affects cosmic information dynamics.

### 4. Gravity/Quantum Information Duality

Establishes a deep connection between gravity theory and quantum information theory, suggesting that the event horizon can be viewed as an information conversion interface between the two theoretical domains.

## Correspondence with Observational Data

In the first image of the Sagittarius A* black hole released in 2022, the observational characteristics of the event horizon are consistent with the information distribution predicted by this theory. The theory predicts that the information distribution on the event horizon should exhibit a ring structure, and the brightness distribution of the ring reflects the non-uniformity of information density.

Actual observational data shows:
1. The Sagittarius A* event horizon indeed exhibits a ring structure
2. The brightness distribution on the ring is non-uniform, which aligns with the theory's predicted information aggregation points
3. The size of the ring is consistent with general relativity predictions, supporting the foundational theoretical framework

## Theoretical Limitations and Unresolved Issues

1. **Singularity Information Model**: This theory does not fully resolve information behavior at spacetime singularities
2. **Quantum Gravity Compatibility**: Still needs integration with a complete quantum gravity theory to address microscale issues
3. **Information Reorganization Details**: The precise microscopic mechanism of SHIFT operations needs further clarification
4. **Observational Verification Challenges**: Some theoretical predictions exceed current observational capabilities, awaiting technological advances
