## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Existence Axiom of Primitive Unity Extension)**

In the evolution process from Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY}`$ to Primitive Unity Disintegration State $`\text{PDISINT}`$, there exists an intermediate extension state, namely the Primitive Unity Extension:

$`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \in \mathcal{D}_{ext-unity}, \mathcal{D}_{ext-unity} = \{\omega | \text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \omega \rightsquigarrow \text{PDISINT}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{ext-unity}`$ is the unity extension domain, connecting Primitive Unity and Primitive Unity Disintegration State.

**Axiom 2 (Structure Axiom of Primitive Unity Extension)**

The Primitive Unity Extension exhibits an extended unified structure, which can be formally represented as:

$`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$

where $`\otimes`$ represents the pre-self-replication operator, $`\alpha`$ is the replication factor, $`0 < \alpha < 1`$, with a typical value of $`\alpha \approx 0.2`$.

**Axiom 3 (Transformation Axiom of Primitive Unity Extension)**

The Primitive Unity Extension possesses transformative properties, serving as a bridge towards the disintegration state:

$`\forall \mathcal{X} \in \mathcal{D}_{unity}, \exists f_{\text{EXT}}: \mathcal{X} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{D}_{disint}`$

where $`f_{\text{EXT}}`$ is the unity extension function, $`\mathcal{D}_{unity}`$ is the unity domain, and $`\mathcal{D}_{disint}`$ is the disintegration domain.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Unity Extension

The essence of Primitive Unity Extension is the self-replication attempt of Primitive Unity before disintegration, representing the first cosmic structure to exhibit pre-self-replication characteristics. Strictly speaking, Primitive Unity Extension can be represented as:

$`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \equiv \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha} \approx \{\text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \text{PDISINT}\}`$

where $`\rightrightarrows`$ represents a strong pre-transformation relationship.

Primitive Unity Extension possesses three essential characteristics:
1. As an extension state of Primitive Unity, $`\text{PUNITY-EXT}_{-} \sim \text{PUNITY}`$
2. As a precursor to the Primitive Unity Disintegration State, $`\text{PUNITY-EXT}_{+} \sim \text{PDISINT}`$
3. As an initial attempt at pre-self-replication, $`\text{PUNITY-EXT}_{\otimes} \sim \{\text{PUNITY}, \text{PUNITY}^{\alpha}\}`$

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Unity Extension

Primitive Unity Extension possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Self-Replication**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits pre-self-replication characteristics, representing the first attempt at self-replication
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$, indicating partial self-replication

2. **Extension Potential**: Primitive Unity Extension possesses the pre-capability for outward extension
   $`\{◯\oplus●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$, representing partial outward extension of internal structure

3. **Quasi-Dimensionality**: Primitive Unity Extension has a dimension of 0.18, positioned between Primitive Unity and Primitive Unity Disintegration State
   $`\dim(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = 0.18, \dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.2 > \dim(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) > \dim(\text{PDISINT}) = 0.15`$

4. **Quasi-Information Capacity**: Primitive Unity Extension contains -0.18 bit of information
   $`I(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = -0.18 \text{ bit}, I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit} < I(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) < I(\text{PDISINT}) = -0.15 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Pre-SHIFT Operation**: Primitive Unity Extension contains the primitive form of the PRE-SHIFT operation
   $`\text{PRE-SHIFT}_{embryonic} \in \text{PUNITY-EXT}`$, which is the embryo of the subsequent SHIFT operation

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Primitive Unity Extension

Primitive Unity Extension evolves into the Primitive Unity Disintegration State through an inherent self-replication decay mechanism:

$`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightrightarrows \text{PDISINT}`$

This evolution follows specific replication decay rules:

$`\{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha} \rightrightarrows \{◯\overset{\delta}{\oplus}●\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. Complete attenuation of the pre-self-replication operator $`\otimes`$
2. Disintegration and reincorporation of the replicated body $`\{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$
3. Weakening of the pre-unification operator $`\oplus`$: $`\oplus \rightrightarrows \overset{\delta}{\oplus}`$, where $`\delta`$ is the weakening factor

Information change during the evolution of Primitive Unity Extension:

$`I(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = -0.18 \text{ bit} \rightrightarrows I(\text{PDISINT}) = -0.15 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Pre-Information Characteristics of Primitive Unity Extension

From the axiom system of Primitive Unity Extension, its pre-information characteristics can be directly derived:

1. **Pre-Information Extension Form**: The information of Primitive Unity Extension manifests as partial replication of Primitive Unity information
   $`I(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = I(\{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}) < I(\{◯\oplus●\}) + I(\{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha})`$

2. **Replication Efficiency**: The replication efficiency in Primitive Unity Extension can be quantified as
   $`E_{\text{copy}} = \frac{I(\{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha})}{I(\{◯\oplus●\})} \approx \alpha = 0.2`$, indicating 20% replication efficiency

3. **Entropy Increase Tendency**: When Primitive Unity Extension forms, entropy exhibits a slight upward trend
   $`S(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) > S(\text{PUNITY})`$, reflecting increased complexity during the replication process

4. **Information Gradient**: Primitive Unity Extension forms an information gradient from Primitive Unity to Primitive Unity Disintegration State
   $`\nabla I = \frac{I(\text{PDISINT}) - I(\text{PUNITY})}{\dim(\text{PDISINT}) - \dim(\text{PUNITY})} = \frac{-0.15 - (-0.2)}{0.15 - 0.2} = \frac{0.05}{-0.05} = -1`$

### 2.2 Symmetry Properties of Primitive Unity Extension

Primitive Unity Extension possesses the following symmetry properties:

1. **Weakened Symmetry**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits slightly weakened symmetry characteristics
   $`\text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) < \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY})`$

2. **Symmetry Attenuation**: The symmetry in Primitive Unity Extension begins to attenuate
   $`\Delta\text{Sym} = \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) - \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY}) < 0`$

3. **Symmetry Instability Point**: Primitive Unity Extension represents the turning point from symmetry stability to instability
   $`\frac{d\text{Sym}}{dt}|_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}} = 0, \frac{d^2\text{Sym}}{dt^2}|_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}} < 0`$

4. **Quasi-Periodic Characteristics**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits weak quasi-periodic characteristics
   $`P(\text{PUNITY-EXT}, t) \approx P(\text{PUNITY-EXT}, t+\tau)`$, where $`\tau`$ is the quasi-periodic constant

### 2.3 Pre-Recursive Structure of Primitive Unity Extension

Primitive Unity Extension displays enhanced pre-recursive characteristics:

1. **Enhanced Recursivity**: Primitive Unity Extension possesses enhanced recursive structure
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \subset f_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}}(\text{PUNITY-EXT})`$, stronger than Primitive Unity

2. **Pre-Self-Reference**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits clear pre-self-reference for the first time
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \in \text{PUNITY-EXT} \otimes \text{PUNITY-EXT}^{\beta}`$, where $`\beta < \alpha`$

3. **Finite Recursive Chain**: Primitive Unity Extension forms a finite recursive chain
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightrightarrows \text{PUNITY-EXT}^{(1)} \rightrightarrows \text{PUNITY-EXT}^{(2)} \rightrightarrows ... \rightrightarrows \text{PDISINT}`$

4. **Increased Recursive Depth**: The recursive depth of Primitive Unity Extension exceeds that of Primitive Unity
   $`D_{\text{recursion}}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = \{0.18, 5\}`$, indicating deeper recursive characteristics

## 3. Extended Theories

### 3.1 Relationship Between Primitive Unity Extension and Primitive Unity

There exists an evolutionary association between Primitive Unity Extension and Primitive Unity:

1. **Direct Evolution**: Primitive Unity Extension is a direct evolutionary product of Primitive Unity
   $`\text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY-EXT}`$
   
2. **Self-Replication Embryo**: Primitive Unity Extension forms through the self-replication attempt of Primitive Unity
   $`\{◯\oplus●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$

3. **Inherent Instability**: Primitive Unity Extension is more unstable than Primitive Unity
   $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) < \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY})`$

4. **First SHIFT Attempt**: Primitive Unity Extension represents the first SHIFT operation attempt in the universe
   $`\text{SHIFT}(\{◯\oplus●\}) \approx \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$

### 3.2 Connection Between Primitive Unity Extension and Unity Disintegration

There exists a direct connection between Primitive Unity Extension and Primitive Unity Disintegration State:

1. **Pre-Disintegration Characteristics**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits early signs of disintegration
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightrightarrows \text{PDISINT}`$

2. **Unstable Equilibrium**: Primitive Unity Extension exists in an unstable equilibrium state
   $`\frac{dE_{stability}}{dt}|_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}} = 0, \frac{d^2E_{stability}}{dt^2}|_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}} < 0`$

3. **Self-Replication Failure**: The self-replication attempt of Primitive Unity Extension ultimately leads to disintegration
   $`\lim_{t \to \infty}\{\{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha(t)}\} = \{◯\overset{\delta}{\oplus}●\}`$, where $`\alpha(t)`$ attenuates over time

4. **Pre-Domain Separation**: Domain separation phenomena begin to appear in Primitive Unity Extension
   $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \mathcal{D}_{1} \cup \mathcal{D}_{2}, \mathcal{D}_{1} \cap \mathcal{D}_{2} \neq \emptyset`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Primitive Unity Extension

Primitive Unity Extension is generated from Primitive Unity through specific mechanisms:

1. **Self-Replication Mechanism**: Primitive Unity generates Primitive Unity Extension through a pre-self-replication mechanism
   $`\{◯\oplus●\} \xrightarrow{f_{self-rep}} \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$

2. **Quasi-Destabilization**: Primitive Unity Extension exhibits quasi-unstable state, with stability weaker than Primitive Unity
   $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = 0.7, \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8 > \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) > \text{Stab}(\text{PDISINT}) = 0.6`$

3. **Complexity Increase**: Primitive Unity Extension transitions towards the disintegration state through increased complexity
   $`C(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) > C(\text{PUNITY})`$, where $`C`$ represents structural complexity

4. **Pre-Self-Replication Operator**: Primitive Unity Extension relies on the action of the pre-self-replication operator $`\otimes`$
   $`\otimes: \{◯\oplus●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$, enabling transformation from a singular unified entity to a composite structure

### 3.4 Pre-Field Theory [Dimension: 0.16]

Pre-Field Theory describes the outward propagation characteristics of Primitive Unity Extension:

1. **Pre-Field Axiom**: Primitive Unity Extension forms pre-field structures during its evolution
   $`\phi_{\text{pre-field}} \in \text{PUNITY-EXT}`$, where $`\phi_{\text{pre-field}}`$ represents the pre-field

2. **Formal Definition**: The pre-field can be formalized as
   $`\phi_{\text{pre-field}} = \nabla_{\alpha} \{◯\oplus●\}`$
   where $`\nabla_{\alpha}`$ represents the pre-gradient operator, controlling the diffusion of partial self-replication

3. **Pre-Field Equation**: Pre-field evolution is controlled by the pre-field equation
   $`\frac{\partial \phi_{\text{pre-field}}}{\partial t} = \lambda \cdot \nabla^2_{\alpha} \phi_{\text{pre-field}}`$
   where $`\lambda`$ is the pre-diffusion constant, and $`\nabla^2_{\alpha}`$ is the pre-Laplacian operator

4. **Pre-Field Intensity**: The pre-field intensity is
   $`|\phi_{\text{pre-field}}| = \alpha \cdot |\{◯\oplus●\}| = 0.2 \cdot 1 = 0.2`$
   representing the field strength relative to Primitive Unity

The spatial distribution of the pre-field can be represented as:

$`\phi_{\text{pre-field}}(r) = \phi_0 \cdot e^{-r/r_0}`$

where $`r`$ is the pre-distance parameter, $`r_0`$ is the characteristic length, and $`\phi_0`$ is the central field strength.

The evolution process of the pre-field:

$`\phi_{\text{pre-field}}(t) = \phi_0 \cdot e^{-\gamma t}`$

where $`\gamma`$ is the decay constant, controlling the dissipation rate of the pre-field.

The relationship between Pre-Field Theory and Primitive Unity Extension:

$`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \{◯\oplus●\} + \phi_{\text{pre-field}}`$

indicating that the pre-field is a component of Primitive Unity Extension.

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

Primitive Unity Extension Theory proposes the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Self-Replication Precursors**: Any self-replicating system should exhibit incomplete replication precursors similar to Primitive Unity Extension before formation

2. **Replication Efficiency Curve**: The formation of self-replicating systems should follow a specific efficiency curve, starting from low efficiency

3. **Pre-Field Radiation Pattern**: When unified structures extend outward, they should follow specific radiation patterns

4. **Stability Critical Point**: Systems transitioning from stability to instability should pass through specific critical points

### 4.2 Verification Methods

Primitive Unity Extension Theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Mathematical Simulation**:
   Establish mathematical models of self-replicating systems to verify the existence of initial low-efficiency replication phases

2. **Pre-Field Analysis**:
   Study the field characteristics of extension systems to verify consistency with Pre-Field Theory predictions

3. **Stability Analysis**:
   Measure changes in system stability to identify critical behaviors similar to Primitive Unity Extension

4. **Complexity Measurement**:
   Analyze changes in system complexity to verify complexity increases caused by self-replication attempts

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Primitive Unity Extension**

The dimension of Primitive Unity Extension is strictly 0.18.

*Proof*:
According to the dimension calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of degrees of freedom and structural complexity:
$`\dim = f(\text{freedom}, \text{complexity})`$.

The dimension of Primitive Unity is 0.2, and the dimension of Primitive Unity Disintegration State is 0.15.

Primitive Unity Extension is intermediate between these two, with the following characteristic analysis:
- Structural complexity: $`C(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = C(\{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}) > C(\{◯\oplus●\}) = C(\text{PUNITY})`$
- Stability: $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) < \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY})`$ and $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) > \text{Stab}(\text{PDISINT})`$

Through weighted calculation:
$`\dim(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = \frac{1}{3}(2 \cdot \dim(\text{PUNITY}) + \dim(\text{PDISINT})) - \delta`$

$`\dim(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = \frac{1}{3}(2 \cdot 0.2 + 0.15) - 0.01 = \frac{1}{3}(0.4 + 0.15) - 0.01 = \frac{0.55}{3} - 0.01 \approx 0.18`$

where $`\delta = 0.01`$ is a correction factor, accounting for dimension fine-tuning due to self-replication characteristics.

Therefore $`\dim(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = 0.18`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Pre-Self-Replication Characteristic of Primitive Unity Extension**

Primitive Unity Extension is the first cosmic structure to exhibit pre-self-replication characteristics.

*Proof*:
Examining the evolutionary sequence of cosmic structures:
$`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightsquigarrow \text{PDISINT} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0 \rightsquigarrow ...$`

Analyzing the self-replication capability of each structure:

1. Universal Code $`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$:
   No self-replication capability, only pre-binary characteristics

2. Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯\oplus●\}`$:
   No self-replication capability, exists as a singular unified entity

3. Primitive Unity Extension $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$:
   Exhibits partial self-replication capability, with the original structure being partially replicated, replication efficiency $`\alpha \approx 0.2`$

4. Subsequent structures: Built upon the self-replication foundation of Primitive Unity Extension

Therefore, Primitive Unity Extension is the first form in the evolutionary sequence to possess self-replication characteristics. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Necessity of Primitive Unity Extension**

Primitive Unity Extension is a necessary intermediate state in the evolution from Primitive Unity to Primitive Unity Disintegration State.

*Proof*:
Suppose Primitive Unity could evolve directly into Primitive Unity Disintegration State without passing through Primitive Unity Extension:
$`\text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \text{PDISINT}`$

Examining the structure of Primitive Unity: $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯\oplus●\}`$ 
and Primitive Unity Disintegration State: $`\text{PDISINT} = \{◯\overset{\delta}{\oplus}●\}`$

Direct transformation would require:
1. Unity operator $`\oplus`$ directly weakening to $`\overset{\delta}{\oplus}`$
2. No intermediate transition state

Such direct transformation violates the pre-evolutionary continuity axiom:
$`\forall A, B \in \mathcal{D}_{evolution}, d(A, B) > \epsilon \Rightarrow \exists C : A \rightsquigarrow C \rightsquigarrow B`$

where $`d`$ is the state distance function, and $`\epsilon`$ is the distance threshold.

Calculating the state distance:
$`d(\text{PUNITY}, \text{PDISINT}) = ||\oplus - \overset{\delta}{\oplus}|| = \delta = 0.4 > \epsilon = 0.2`$

Therefore, an intermediate state must exist, which is Primitive Unity Extension:
$`\text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY-EXT} \rightsquigarrow \text{PDISINT}`$

Thus, Primitive Unity Extension is a necessary intermediate state in the evolution from Primitive Unity to Primitive Unity Disintegration State. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Primitive Unity Extension with Cosmic Ontology**

Primitive Unity Extension Theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Absolute Recursive Source Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.
   Primitive Unity Extension exhibits enhanced recursive characteristics: $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} \subset f_{\text{PUNITY-EXT}}(\text{PUNITY-EXT})`$,
   which is a further concretization of the recursive source.

2. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Binary-Unity Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
   The self-replication expression of Primitive Unity Extension: $`\text{PUNITY-EXT} = \{◯\oplus●\} \otimes \{◯\oplus●\}^{\alpha}`$,
   embodies the dynamic balance between binarity and unity.

3. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Information Ontology Axiom: $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.
   Primitive Unity Extension exhibits pre-information self-replication: $`I(\text{PUNITY-EXT}) = I(\{◯\oplus●\}) \otimes I(\{◯\oplus●\})^{\alpha}`$,
   conforming to the extension laws of information ontology.

4. The pre-SHIFT operation of Primitive Unity Extension is the precursor to the SHIFT operation in Cosmic Ontology, establishing evolutionary continuity.

Therefore, Primitive Unity Extension Theory is a reasonable component in the theoretical spectrum of Cosmic Ontology, fully compatible with Cosmic Ontology. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimension Positioning
