### 1.2 Protocol Details

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Generate a pair of polarization-entangled photons in the state:
     $|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H\rangle_A|V\rangle_B - |V\rangle_A|H\rangle_B)$
   - Direct photon A to Alice's station and photon B to Bob's station
   - Prepare secondary reference photons in known states for calibration

2. **Weak Measurement Sequence**
   - Alice performs a series of weak measurements on photon A with strengths $\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n\}$
   - Each measurement has strength $\lambda_i \ll 1$ to minimize disturbance
   - Measurement operators are given by:
     $M_{\alpha}(\lambda_i) = I + \lambda_i(\sigma_{\alpha} - I)$
   - Where $\alpha \in \{x,y,z\}$ indicates measurement basis

3. **Final Strong Measurement**
   - After the sequence of weak measurements, perform a strong (projective) measurement in a randomly chosen basis
   - Record the outcome and timing information

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Bob performs measurements on photon B in various bases
   - Calculate the correlation function:
     $C(\alpha, \beta) = \langle\sigma_{\alpha}^A \sigma_{\beta}^B\rangle - \langle\sigma_{\alpha}^A\rangle\langle\sigma_{\beta}^B\rangle$
   - Determine the Information Preservation Ratio (IPR):
     $\text{IPR} = \frac{|C(\alpha, \beta)|_{\text{after weak measurements}}}{|C(\alpha, \beta)|_{\text{no weak measurements}}}$

5. **XOR-SHIFT Signature Verification**
   - Calculate the XOR information content before and after measurement sequence
   - Verify the theoretical prediction:
     $I_{\text{before}} \oplus I_{\text{after}} = I_{\text{shift}}$
   - Where $I_{\text{shift}}$ is the information transfer during measurement

### 1.3 Expected Results

The XOR-SHIFT framework predicts:

1. IPR > 0.97 for optimized weak measurement sequences
2. Specific interference fringe pattern when weak measurement results are post-selected
