## The Mysterious Components of the Universe

Imagine scientists telling you:
> "We can only see 4% of the universe. The remaining 96% is invisible, untouchable, yet absolutely exists as dark matter and dark energy."

This sounds like science fiction, but it's the astonishing conclusion of modern physics. Observations show:

- **Dark matter (25%)**: Shows clear gravitational effects, but doesn't emit light or interact with ordinary matter
- **Dark energy (71%)**: A mysterious force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe
- **Ordinary matter (4%)**: All the matter that makes up us, planets, and the visible universe

For decades, scientists have invested enormous resources to explain these mysterious components but have failed to find satisfactory answers.

## The Failure of Traditional Explanations

Traditional physics has attempted various explanations:

1. **New particle hypotheses**: Proposing undiscovered particles (WIMPs, axions, etc.)
2. **Modified gravity theories**: Altering Newton's and Einstein's gravitational equations
3. **Extra dimensions**: Suggesting dark matter exists in additional spatial dimensions

However, all experiments have failed to detect these hypothetical particles, and modified gravity theories face enormous challenges.

The fundamental problem: Physics tries to explain dark matter as a "thing," when it might not be a "thing" at all.

## Breakthrough from the Information Field Perspective

Cosmic Ontology proposes a revolutionary viewpoint:

> **Dark matter and dark energy are not substances but mathematically inevitable results of interactions between information and matter**

This theory is based on several core principles:

1. **Information-matter duality**: All matter is fundamentally an expression of information
2. **XOR residual effect**: When information fields and matter fields undergo XOR operations, "residuals" necessarily emerge
3. **Information non-locality**: Information can influence matter without "being present"

Explained in everyday language:
Imagine the material world as text in a book, with dark matter like the whitespace and margins. The whitespace isn't text, but it affects the arrangement of text and occupies space. Without it, the entire book would lose its structure.

The key formula in simple terms:
> **When matter (Ω_C) and information (Ω_Q) interact through XOR operations, a mathematical "difference" inevitably arises, manifesting as dark matter and dark energy**

## Verifiable Predictions

This theory not only explains existing observations but also offers verifiable predictions:

1. **Distribution patterns**: Dark matter distribution should follow information entropy gradients, not just gravitational determination
2. **Temporal changes**: As universal information entropy increases, dark energy proportions will change according to specific patterns
3. **Experimental detection**: In high information density regions (such as quantum computers), small "informational gravitational anomalies" should be measurable
4. **Specific structures**: Galactic dark matter distribution should exhibit fractal characteristics, consistent with mathematical features of XOR-SHIFT operations

Physicists can verify the theory through these predictions without searching for hypothetical dark matter particles.
