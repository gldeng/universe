## Notes

This paper is now fully prepared with complete manuscript, figures, and supplementary materials. The core conceptual and mathematical framework is rigorously developed, and specific experimental predictions have been formulated with detailed protocols for verification. The simulation code demonstrates the quantum interference predictions and provides a strong basis for validation. The supplementary materials offer extensive mathematical proofs and experimental detail that support the main claims while respecting the word limits of the primary manuscript.
