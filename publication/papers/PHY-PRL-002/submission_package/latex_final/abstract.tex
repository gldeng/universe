We present experimentally testable predictions derived from the Universe Ontology (UO) theoretical framework, specifically focusing on Quantum XOR Causal Invariance phenomena. The UO theory, based on fundamental FLIP-XOR-SHIFT operations, unifies quantum and classical physical descriptions through information field dynamics. We identify four key experimental predictions: (1) quantum causal invariance under XOR-SHIFT transformations, experimentally verifiable through modified quantum delayed-choice setups; (2) non-local XOR correlation preservation in entangled systems, testable via specific measurement protocols on Bell-type experiments; (3) quantum phase transition signatures at critical XOR-SHIFT coupling, observable in artificial quantum systems; and (4) phase-dependent quantum coherence oscillations during sequential XOR operations. These predictions enable critical experimental assessment of the UO framework across multiple quantum physics domains, revealing fundamental connections between information operations and physical reality.
