## Core Theory Overview

[Quantum-Classical Dualism Core Theory Formal Description](../formal_theory_core_en.md) fully describes the foundational axiom system, conceptual framework, and core branch theories of dualism. This document provides only a brief overview of the core theory; please refer to the core theory document for detailed content.

## 1. Core Axiom System

### 1.1 Axiom Set

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $`\Omega_Q`$ (a space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $`\Omega_C`$ (a space of determined reality), connected through an interface domain $`\mathcal{I}`$:

$`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}`$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition) and classical information (deterministic knowledge):

$`I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical determinism), $`I(\psi)`$ is the total information content of state $`\psi`$, and $`I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)`$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that perform quantum→classical transformation, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{classical\_knowledge}}{S_{classical\_entropy}+\epsilon}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classicalization operator (the ability to transform quantum possibilities into deterministic knowledge), $`\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the quantization operator (the ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $`K_C^\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $`\epsilon`$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization ability and quantization ability, and the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$`D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{classical\_knowledge}}{S_{classical\_entropy}+\epsilon}`$

$`\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}`$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within a specific dimensional range based on their capabilities.

### 1.2 Basic Structure Definitions

#### 1.2.1 Quantum Domain Structure

The quantum domain is defined as:

$`\Omega_Q = \{\psi \in \mathcal{H} \; | \; \psi \text{ satisfies superposition and non-locality}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{H}`$ is the Hilbert space, and the basic properties of quantum state $`\psi`$ are:

1. **Superposition**: $`\psi = \sum_i \alpha_i |i\rangle, \; \sum_i |\alpha_i|^2 = 1`$
2. **Entanglement**: $`\psi_{AB} \neq \psi_A \otimes \psi_B`$
3. **Non-locality**: $`P(A,B|a,b) \neq P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)`$

Quantum domain entropy: $`S_Q(\psi) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)`, where $`\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|`$

#### 1.2.2 Classical Domain Structure

The classical domain is defined as:

$`\Omega_C = \{(K_C, S_C) \; | \; K_C \text{ is the classical knowledge set}, S_C \text{ is the classical entropy}\}`$

where the basic components are:

1. **Classical Knowledge**: $`K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}`$
2. **Classical Entropy**: $`S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i`$
3. **Locality**: $`P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)`$

#### 1.2.3 Interface Domain Structure

The interface domain is defined as:

$`\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} \; | \; \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}(x)`$ is the decoherence measure function, and $`\mathcal{D}_c`$ is the critical decoherence threshold. The interface dynamics satisfy:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)`$

#### 1.2.4 Conversion Operators

The classicalization superoperator $`\mathcal{C}`$ is defined as:

$`\mathcal{C}(\rho) = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i`$

The quantization superoperator $`\mathcal{Q}`$ is defined as:

$`\mathcal{Q}(K_C) = \sum_j w_j |\phi_j\rangle\langle\phi_j|`$

where $`P_i`$ is the projection operator, $`w_j`$ is the weight coefficient, and $`|\phi_j\rangle`$ is the quantum basis state.

## 2. Derived Structures and Theorems

### 2.1 Observer Structure

**Theorem 1: Observer Equivalence**

All observers satisfy:

$`\mathcal{O} \cong \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}, D_{\mathcal{O}}\} \cong \text{Black Hole}(M, J, Q, \Phi)`$

where $`\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}`$ corresponds to black hole absorption (classicalization), $`\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}`$ corresponds to black hole radiation (quantization).

**Theorem 2: Observer Dimension Network Dynamics**

Observer dimension satisfies a nonlinear dynamical equation:

$`\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})`$

Consensus formation in the observer network follows:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2`$

### 2.2 Dimension Continuum Structure

Dimension continuum $`\mathcal{D} = [D_0, D_{\infty}]`$ is divided into five main regions:

1. **Zero Dimension Area** (D0): $`\mathcal{D}_0 = \{\emptyset\} \equiv \text{pure possibility field}`$
2. **Low Dimensional Area** (D1-D6): $`\mathcal{D}_{1-6} = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \mathcal{C}_i \otimes \mathcal{S}_i`$
3. **Medium Dimensional Area** (D7-D10): $`\mathcal{D}_{7-10} = \mathcal{Q}_{\text{low}} \leftrightarrow \mathcal{C}_{\text{high}}`$
4. **High Dimensional Area** (D11-D20): $`\mathcal{D}_{11-20} = \prod_{i=11}^{20} \mathcal{Q}_i^{\alpha_i} \cdot \mathcal{C}_i^{1-\alpha_i}`$
5. **Super Dimensional Area** (D21-D∞): $`\mathcal{D}_{21-\infty} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \mathcal{Q}_n \otimes \mathcal{T}_n`$

Dimension transitions satisfy: $`D_i \to D_j, \quad \Delta E = hf_{ij}`$

### 2.3 Information Phase Transition Structure

The information phase transition operator $`\Phi`$ acts on information state $`\mathcal{S}`$:

$`\Phi: \mathcal{S}(\lambda) \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'(\lambda+\delta\lambda)`$

Near the critical point $`\lambda_c`$, the order parameter behaves as:

$`\eta(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < \lambda_c \\
(\lambda - \lambda_c)^\beta, & \lambda \geq \lambda_c
\end{cases}`$

Observer-induced phase transition probability:

$`P(\text{quantum} \to \text{classical}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(D_{\mathcal{O}} - D_{\mathcal{O}}^c)}}`$

### 2.4 Energy Equivalence Principle

Energy equivalence relationship between quantum and classical domains:

$`E = mc^2 = h\nu = h \cdot f_{\text{entanglement}}`$

Entanglement equivalent frequency:

$`f_{\text{entanglement}} = \frac{c^2}{L_P^2} \cdot S_E(\rho_{AB})`$

where $`S_E(\rho_{AB})`$ is the entanglement entropy.

## 3. Derivation Mechanism for Branch Theories

### 3.1 Derivation Rules

The general form for deriving branch theories $`T_i`$ from the core axiom set:

$`T_i = \mathcal{G}(\text{Axiom Set}, D_i, \mathcal{A}_i)`$

where $`\mathcal{G}`$ is the theory generation operator, $`D_i`$ is the theory dimension, and $`\mathcal{A}_i`$ is the application domain.

### 3.2 Dimension Projection

The dimension projection operator $`\mathcal{P}_{i \to j}`$ is defined as:

$`\mathcal{P}_{i \to j}: \mathcal{I}_{D_i} \to \mathcal{I}_{D_j}`$

Inter-dimensional information transfer efficiency:

$`\eta_{i,j} = \frac{\mathcal{I}_{\text{transferred}}}{\mathcal{I}_{\text{input}}}`$

### 3.3 Theory Fusion

The fusion operator $`\mathcal{F}`$ for theories $`T_i`$ and $`T_j`$:

$`\mathcal{F}(T_i, T_j) = T_{i,j}`$

where $`T_{i,j}`$ is the fused theory, satisfying:

$`D_{T_{i,j}} = f(D_{T_i}, D_{T_j})`$

## 4. Unified Expression

The binary structure of the universe can be elegantly expressed through an Euler-like formula:

$`e^{i\Phi} = \frac{I_{\text{Classical Domain}}}{E_{\text{Quantum Domain}}}`$

When $`\Phi = \pi`$, the system reaches a classical-quantum equilibrium state: $`e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0`$

## Quantum-Classical Dualism Dimensional Notation and Branch Theory Navigation

Within the Quantum-Classical Dualism framework, each branch theory not only has its research content but also possesses specific dimensional attributes. Dimensional attributes represent the theory's positioning in the quantum domain-classical domain continuum, reflecting the degree to which the theory emphasizes quantum characteristics (superposition states and possibilities) versus classical characteristics (determinism and realization). Below is a navigation list organized by subject category, including dimensional notation and theory interdependencies.

### Dimensional Explanation

Dimensional notation uses a D1-D11 scale, where:
- **D1-D3**: Deep classical domain theories, focusing on deterministic structures and implementation
- **D4-D6**: Classical-leaning theories, primarily dealing with classical information and deterministic systems
- **D7-D8**: Balanced theories, handling quantum-classical interfaces and transformation processes
- **D9-D10**: Quantum-leaning theories, primarily dealing with quantum possibilities and creativity
- **D11+**: Deep quantum domain theories, focusing on pure possibilities and full quantum effects
- **D∞**: Cross-dimensional full-spectrum theories, spanning all dimensional levels

The higher the dimensional value, the more the theory emphasizes quantum domain characteristics (superposition states, possibilities, creativity); the lower the dimensional value, the more the theory emphasizes classical domain characteristics (determinism, implementation, structure).
