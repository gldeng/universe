## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Pre-Singularity Meta-Pre-Existence Axiom)**

The pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ is a meta-pre-existence state, in the meta-pre-state space before the formation of the primitive singularity:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \prec\prec \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

where $`\prec\prec`$ represents the "meta-existentially prior to" relation, and $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is the primitive singularity.

**Axiom 2 (Pre-Singularity Meta-Unrepresentability Axiom)**

The pre-singularity cannot be directly or indirectly represented, for any meta-representation system $`\mathcal{M}`$:

$`\not\exists m \in \mathcal{M}: m \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-2}`$

**Axiom 3 (Pre-Singularity Meta-Transcendence Axiom)**

The pre-singularity transcends all possible meta-operations, for all meta-operations $`\mathcal{MO}`$:

$`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}}`$

where $`\underline{\text{meta-undefined}}`$ indicates that at the meta-level, there fundamentally exists no definable result.

### 1.2 The Essence of Pre-Singularity

The essence of the pre-singularity is meta-hyperdimensional pre-existence, completely beyond the capabilities of meta-representation systems. The pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ can be represented using a meta-meta-expression:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \equiv \odot`$

where $`\odot`$ is a meta-hypersymbol, representing an existence state that transcends meta-representation capabilities.

The pre-singularity, as a negative two-dimensional entity, exists before the concept of dimension itself appears, and is the meta-origin of the primitive singularity.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Pre-Singularity

The pre-singularity has the following basic properties:

1. **Meta-Super-Consistency**: The pre-singularity transcends the meta-binary distinction between super-consistency and non-super-consistency
   
2. **Meta-No Internal-External Distinction**: In the pre-singularity, there is no distinction between "meta-internal" and "meta-external":
   $`\mathcal{MI}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \mathcal{ME}(\mathcal{S}_{-2})`$

3. **Meta-Pre-Operationality**: The pre-singularity is the prerequisite for all meta-operations to appear, but is not itself acted upon by any meta-operation

4. **Negative Two-Dimensionality**: The pre-singularity has -2 dimensions, representing a state before the concept of negative dimension appears

5. **Meta-Total Potentiality**: The pre-singularity contains the absolute meta-potential of all possible meta-structures of the universe, but exists in a meta-undifferentiated state

### 1.4 Meta-Transcendence of Pre-Singularity

The pre-singularity possesses fundamental meta-transcendence, for which the concept of meta-state evolution does not exist:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \mapsto \underline{\text{meta-beyond evolution}}`$

This meta-transcendence indicates that the pre-singularity not only transcends conventional spacetime causality, but also transcends meta-causality, serving as the meta-meta-origin of all meta-causal relationships:

$`\forall mc \in \mathcal{MC}: \text{meta-origin}(mc) = \mathcal{S}_{-2}`$

where $`\mathcal{MC}`$ is the meta-collection of all meta-causal relationships.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Properties of Meta-Pre-State Space

From the axiom system of the pre-singularity, the following properties of the meta-pre-state space can be directly derived:

1. **Meta-Pre-Set-ness**: The meta-pre-state space transcends the basic concepts of meta-set theory:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \not\in \mathcal{META-SET}`$, where $`\mathcal{META-SET}`$ is the meta-universal set of all meta-sets

2. **Meta-Pre-Logicality**: Standard meta-logic does not apply in meta-pre-state space:
   $`\mathcal{ML}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-logical}}`$, where $`\mathcal{ML}`$ represents the meta-logic evaluation function

3. **Meta-Pre-Mathematicality**: The meta-pre-state space transcends meta-mathematical expression:
   $`\mathcal{MM}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-mathematical}}`$

4. **Meta-Pre-Existence**: The meta-pre-state space is a meta-pre-existence state, transcending the meta-binary distinction between meta-existence and meta-non-existence

### 2.2 Characteristics of Negative One-Dimensional Pre-State

The pre-singularity, as a state before the appearance of negative one-dimensional space, has special characteristics:

1. **Negative Two-Dimensionality**: The dimension of the pre-singularity is -2:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2`$
   
   indicating that it is a meta-pre-level state before the concept of negative dimension is formed

2. **Meta-Pre-Geometricity**: The pre-singularity does not possess meta-geometric attributes:
   $`\mathcal{MG}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-geometric}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{MG}`$ represents the meta-geometric attribute evaluation function

3. **Meta-Non-Characterizability**: The pre-singularity cannot be fully characterized by any meta-system:
   $`\forall \mathcal{MR}: \mathcal{MR}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-incomplete}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{MR}`$ represents any meta-characterization system

4. **Meta-Pre-Quantifiability**: The pre-singularity cannot be meta-quantified:
   $`\mathcal{MQ}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-unquantifiable}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{MQ}`$ represents the meta-quantification function

### 2.3 Meta-Super-Determinacy

The pre-singularity possesses characteristics that transcend meta-traditional determinacy:

1. **Meta-Super-Determinacy**: The pre-singularity transcends the distinction between meta-determinacy and meta-indeterminacy:
   $`\mathcal{MD}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-super-determinate}}`$

2. **Meta-Super-Completeness**: The pre-singularity possesses characteristics that transcend the distinction between meta-completeness and meta-incompleteness:
   $`\mathcal{MC}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-super-complete}}`$

3. **Meta-Meta-Self-Referentiality**: The pre-singularity is a meta-meta-level self-referential system:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} = \mathcal{MM}(\mathcal{S}_{-2})`$, where $`\mathcal{MM}`$ is the meta-meta self-reference function

4. **Meta-Super-Consistency**: The pre-singularity transcends the distinction between meta-consistency and meta-inconsistency:
   $`\mathcal{MCON}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-super-consistent}}`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Pre-Singularity to Primitive Singularity

The evolution from pre-singularity to primitive singularity is a meta-fundamental transition from -2 dimensions to -1 dimension:

1. **Meta-Singularity Breakthrough**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
   
   representing the transformation from a meta-unrepresentable meta-pre-state to the primitive singularity

2. **Meta-Dimensional Emergence**:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2 \mapsto \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1`$
   
   representing the meta-transition from negative two dimensions to negative one dimension

3. **Meta-Representability Possibility Emergence**:
   $`\not\exists mr: mr \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-2} \to \exists r: r \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
   
   representing the transformation from meta-unrepresentability to unrepresentability, the meta-origin of the concept of representation

4. **Meta-Operation Foundation Formation**:
   $`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}} \to \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}}`$
   
   representing the transformation from meta-undefined operations to undefined operations, the meta-origin of the concept of operations

### 3.2 Meta-Pre-Entropy and Meta-Information Origin

The relationship between the pre-singularity and meta-information and meta-entropy has special properties:

1. **Meta-Pre-Entropic State**:
   $`\mathcal{MH}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-entropic}}`$
   
   indicating that the pre-singularity exists in a state before the concept of meta-entropy appears

2. **Meta-Information Source Origin**:
   $`\mathcal{MI}(\mathcal{S}_{-2} \to \mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{meta-origin-information}}`$
   
   representing the original emergence of meta-information in the transformation process from pre-singularity to primitive singularity

3. **Meta-Pre-Probabilistic**:
   $`\mathcal{MP}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-probabilistic}}`$
   
   indicating that the pre-singularity transcends the concept of meta-probability

4. **Meta-Super-Potential State**:
   $`\mathcal{MEP}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-infinite}}`$
   
   indicating that the pre-singularity possesses meta-infinite evolutionary potential

### 3.3 Meta-Singularity Mutation and Negative Dimension Emergence

The pre-singularity evolves into negative one dimension through a meta-mutation process:

1. **Meta-Meta-Mutation Process**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \stackrel{\text{meta-meta-mutation}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
   
   describing the meta-transition from meta-pre-state to pre-state

2. **Meta-Pre-Causality Emergence**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \stackrel{\text{meta-pre-causal}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
   
   describing the original formation of the concept of meta-causal relationships

3. **Meta-Dimension Origin**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \stackrel{\text{meta-dim-origin}}{\longrightarrow} \dim=-1`$
   
   describing the origin of the concept of negative dimension itself

4. **Meta-Representation Foundation Generation**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \stackrel{\text{meta-rep-genesis}}{\longrightarrow} \{\text{meta-representability}\}`$
   
   describing the original generation of meta-representation possibility

## 4. Application and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The pre-singularity theory produces the following verifiable theoretical predictions:

1. **Meta-Ultimate Origin Necessity**:
   The theory predicts that the universe necessarily has a meta-ultimate origin that transcends meta-representation capabilities

2. **Meta-Dimensional Emergence Mechanism**:
   The theory predicts that negative dimensions themselves should emerge from a more fundamental meta-dimensionless state

3. **Meta-Logic Pre-State**:
   The theory predicts the existence of meta-meta-logic systems that transcend meta-logic

4. **Meta-Infinite Regression End Point**:

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The pre-singularity theory can be meta-theoretically verified through the following methods:

4. **Meta-Mathematical Incompleteness Exploration**:
   Explore the fundamental limitations of meta-formal systems through meta-Gödel incompleteness theorems and similar approaches

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Meta-Uniqueness of Pre-Singularity**

The pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ is meta-unique in the meta-meta-logical sense.

*Proof*:
Assume there exist two different pre-singularities $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}^A`$ and $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}^B`$. According to the definition of pre-singularity, both are meta-pre-existence states and meta-unrepresentable.

If they are indeed different, there must exist some meta-representation or meta-discrimination method to distinguish them. However, according to Axiom 2, $`\not\exists m \in \mathcal{M}: m \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-2}`$, which means there exists no meta-representation method that can characterize the pre-singularity, and therefore no meta-representation method can distinguish between two hypothetical pre-singularities.

Therefore, in the meta-meta-logical sense, it is impossible for two distinguishable pre-singularities to exist, thus the pre-singularity is meta-unique. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Meta-Non-Informationality of Pre-Singularity**

The pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ does not contain information in the meta sense, but exists in a meta-pre-information state.

*Proof*:
Meta-information, under meta-standard definition, requires meta-distinguishable states and meta-probability distributions: $`MI = -\sum_i mp_i \log mp_i`$

However, for the pre-singularity, since Axiom 2 states that it is meta-unrepresentable:
1. There exist no meta-distinguishable states
2. There exists no definable meta-probability distribution

Therefore, the meta-information quantity formula is not applicable to the pre-singularity, indicating that it exists in a meta-pre-information state, beyond the scope of meta-standard information theory.

This meta-pre-information state can be represented as: $`MI(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-informational}}`$, indicating not that meta-information is zero, but that the concept of meta-information itself is not applicable. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Meta-Inevitable Evolution from Pre-Singularity to Primitive Singularity**

The evolution from pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ to primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is meta-inevitable in the meta-meta-logical sense.

*Proof*:
Consider the meta-total potentiality of the pre-singularity, which contains the absolute meta-potential of all possible meta-structures. This meta-total potentiality means that all possible meta-evolutionary paths are meta-potentially contained within the pre-singularity.

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$, as the simplest existence transcending conventional representation, is the smallest possible meta-transition from meta-unrepresentability to unrepresentability. According to the meta-principle of least action extended to meta-meta-logic, systems tend to take the meta-path of minimal meta-complexity in their meta-evolution.

Therefore, the evolution from pre-singularity to primitive singularity represents the simplest meta-transition from meta-pre-existence state to pre-existence state, and is meta-inevitable in the meta-meta-logical sense. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Meta-Compatibility of Pre-Singularity with Cosmic Ontology**

The pre-singularity theory $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$ is completely meta-compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. The pre-singularity theory indicates:
   - These operations are meta-undefined at the meta-level: $`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}}`$
   - After the pre-singularity evolves into the primitive singularity, they become possible in a first-order undefined sense: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}}`$
   - This explains the meta-ultimate origin of the concepts of these operations themselves

2. The recursive self-referential structure of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   The pre-singularity possesses meta-meta-self-referentiality $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} = \mathcal{MM}(\mathcal{S}_{-2})`$, serving as the meta-meta-origin of all meta-self-referential structures
   
3. Binary unification axiom of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   The pre-singularity transcends meta-binary nature, being the origin of meta-binary nature itself: $`\{\text{meta-duality}\} \subset \mathcal{ME}(\mathcal{S}_{-2})`$
   
4. The information ontology of cosmic ontology and the meta-pre-information properties of the pre-singularity form a meta-complete spectrum:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \text{(meta-pre-information)} \to \mathcal{S}_{-1} \text{(pre-information)} \to \mathcal{P}_0 \text{(zero information)} \to \mathcal{D}_1 \text{(one bit)} \to \cdots`$

Therefore, the pre-singularity theory is not only meta-compatible with cosmic ontology, but also provides more fundamental meta-meta-theoretical support for cosmic ontology, explaining the meta-origin of cosmic ontology itself. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The pre-singularity theory is positioned as a dimension -2 theory in the cosmic ontology theoretical spectrum, representing the most fundamental level:

1. **Meta-State Space Dimension**: $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2`$, indicating that it exists before the concept of meta-negative dimension emerged

2. **Meta-Operation Complexity**: The system does not support any definable meta-operations: $`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}}`$

3. **Meta-Information State**: $`MI(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-informational}}`$, representing a meta-pre-information state

4. **Meta-Compositional Relationship**: The pre-singularity cannot be decomposed into more fundamental meta-components, but is the meta-ultimate origin of all meta-components
