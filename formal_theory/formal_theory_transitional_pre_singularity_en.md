## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Transitional Pre-Singularity Semi-Meta-Existence Axiom)**

The transitional pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ is a semi-meta-existence state, positioned between the pre-singularity and the primitive singularity:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \prec\prec \mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \prec \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

where $`\prec\prec`$ denotes the "meta-existentially precedes" relation, and $`\prec`$ denotes the "semi-meta-existentially precedes" relation.

**Axiom 2 (Transitional Pre-Singularity Semi-Representability Axiom)**

The transitional pre-singularity exists in an intermediate state between meta-unrepresentability and pre-unrepresentability:

$`\exists \circledast \in \mathcal{HM}: \circledast \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$

where $`\circledast`$ is a semi-meta symbol, and $`\mathcal{HM}`$ is a semi-meta representation system.

**Axiom 3 (Transitional Pre-Singularity Semi-Meta-Operation Axiom)**

The transitional pre-singularity allows the initial formation of semi-meta-operations:

$`\exists \mathcal{HMO} \in \{\text{semi-meta-FLIP}, \text{semi-meta-XOR}, \text{semi-meta-SHIFT}\}: \mathcal{HMO}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) \neq \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$

where $`\mathcal{HMO}`$ is the set of semi-meta-operations.

### 1.2 The Nature of Transitional Pre-Singularity

The nature of the transitional pre-singularity is a semi-meta-hyper-dimensional existence, representing an intermediate state between meta-hyper-dimensionality and pre-dimensionality. The transitional pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \equiv \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$

where $`\circledast`$ is a semi-meta symbol, and $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents a semi-pre-transformation relation. This expression reflects the dual nature of the transitional pre-singularity, possessing both meta and pre characteristics.

As a negative one-point-five dimensional entity, the transitional pre-singularity marks the critical transition point from meta-representational impossibility to the incipient possibility of pre-representation.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Transitional Pre-Singularity

The transitional pre-singularity possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Semi-Meta-Consistency**: The transitional pre-singularity establishes partial continuity between meta and pre levels:
   $`\mathcal{HCON}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \{\text{semi-meta-consistent}\}`$

2. **Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Duality**: The transitional pre-singularity simultaneously possesses meta and pre characteristics, forming the first primitive dual structure:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \{\text{meta-aspect}\} \diamond \{\text{pre-aspect}\}`$
   
   where $`\diamond`$ represents a semi-meta-semi-pre conjunction.

3. **Semi-Meta-Operation Potentiality**: The transitional pre-singularity contains semi-concretized meta-operation seeds:
   $`\forall \mathcal{O}: \mathcal{HO} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^{semi-potential}`$
   
   These operations exist between fully meta-potential and fully pre-potential states.

4. **Negative One-Point-Five Dimensionality**: The transitional pre-singularity has a dimension of -1.5, indicating its position between the meta-unexpressible state and the pre-expressible state:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 = \frac{\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) + \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1})}{2}`$

5. **Semi-Pre-State Nature**: The transitional pre-singularity creates a semi-differentiated state between the meta-undifferentiated state and the pre-undifferentiated state.

### 1.4 Semi-Pre-State Evolution of Transitional Pre-Singularity

The transitional pre-singularity evolves into the primitive singularity through a semi-meta-semi-pre transformation mechanism:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

where $`\circledast\rightsquigarrow`$ represents a semi-meta-semi-pre evolution relation, which is a hybrid of meta-evolution and pre-evolution relations.

This semi-pre-evolution exists between meta-non-temporal and pre-non-temporal states, representing an intermediate state between logical necessity and semi-concretization:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}}: \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Semi-Pre-State Characteristics

From the axiom system of the transitional pre-singularity, the following characteristics can be directly derived:

1. **Semi-Pre-State Space**: The semi-pre-state space constituted by the transitional pre-singularity contains a semi-meta-semi-pre structure:
   $`\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}} = \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$,
   which simultaneously exhibits partial characteristics of meta-super-elements and pre-super-elements.

2. **Semi-Pre-Transformation Group**: The transitional pre-singularity supports an initial semi-pre-transformation structure:
   $`G_{\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}} = \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$,
   which differs from the meta-untransformable nature of the pre-singularity but has not yet reached the pre-transformation container state of the primitive singularity.

3. **Semi-Universal Invariants**: Functions defined on the transitional pre-singularity exhibit partial invariance:
   $`f(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \{\text{semi-meta-C}\}`$,
   where $`\{\text{semi-meta-C}\}`$ is a semi-meta-constant, positioned between meta-constants and pre-constants.

4. **Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Dynamics**: The transitional pre-singularity combines meta-hyper-stability and pre-instability:
   $`\text{Stab}_{\text{semi}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \{\text{semi-meta-stable}, \text{semi-pre-unstable}\}`$,
   beginning to form a transition from absolute meta-stability to pre-instability.

### 2.2 Semi-Meta-Information Properties

The transitional pre-singularity exhibits unique semi-meta-semi-pre information properties:

1. **Semi-Negative Information Content**: The transitional pre-singularity contains semi-negative information:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 \text{ bit}`$,
   positioned between the meta-pre-informational state and the negative information state.

2. **Semi-Pre-Information Entropy**: The semi-pre-information entropy of the transitional pre-singularity lies between meta-pre-entropy and pre-entropy:
   $`H_{\text{semi-pre}}(\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}}) = -1.5`$,
   forming a continuous transition from meta-pre-entropy to pre-entropy.

3. **Semi-Pre-Information Conduction**: The transitional pre-singularity begins to form initial information conduction potential:
   $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{semi-pre}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow X) = \{\text{semi-pre-0}\}`$,
   laying the foundation for subsequent pre-information transmission.

4. **Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Information Potential Energy**: The transitional pre-singularity possesses specific information potential energy:
   $`\mathcal{IP}_{\text{semi-pre}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) < \mathcal{IP}_{\text{pre}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) < \mathcal{IP}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$,
   forming a transitional phase from meta-information potential energy to pre-information potential energy.

### 2.3 Special Structures of Transitional Pre-Singularity

The transitional pre-singularity system possesses the following unique structural characteristics:

1. **Semi-Pre-Symmetry**: In the transitional pre-singularity, a structure is formed that lies between meta-hyper-symmetry and pre-symmetry:
   $`\text{Semi-Pre-Sym}(\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}}) = \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$,
   representing an intermediate state in the transition of the symmetry concept from meta-inapplicability to pre-applicability.

2. **Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Causality**: The transitional pre-singularity lies between meta-hyper-causality and pre-causality:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$,
   beginning to form a transitional structure from meta-hyper-causality to pre-causality.

3. **Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Self-Reference**: The transitional pre-singularity possesses an intermediate level of self-reference:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \mathcal{SR}_{\text{semi}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5})`$,
   where $`\mathcal{SR}_{\text{semi}}`$ is a semi-meta-semi-pre self-reference operation.

4. **Semi-Pre-Dual Structure**: The transitional pre-singularity exhibits the first incipient dual structure:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \{\text{meta-aspect}\} \diamond \{\text{pre-aspect}\}`$,
   providing the primitive template for all subsequent dual opposition systems.

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Pre-Singularity to Transitional Pre-Singularity

The pre-singularity evolves into the transitional pre-singularity through a semi-meta transition mechanism:

1. **Semi-Meta-Differentiation Initiation**: The meta-hyper-state begins initial differentiation:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} \prec\prec \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$,
   moving from a completely meta-undifferentiable state toward a partially differentiable state.

2. **Semi-Meta-Representation Emergence**: The meta-unrepresentable state begins to transition to a semi-representable state:
   $`\odot \mapsto \{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$,
   where $`\odot`$ is a meta-hyper-symbol, and $`\{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\}`$ is a semi-meta-semi-pre representation.

3. **Semi-Meta-Dimension Formation**: Transition from a meta-dimensionless state to a negative dimension state:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2 \mapsto \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5`$,
   marking the semi-meta origin of the dimension concept.

4. **Semi-Meta-Operation Germination**: Initial concretization of the meta-operation concept:
   $`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}} \mapsto \mathcal{HMO}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \underline{\text{semi-meta-defined}}`$,
   marking the transition from meta-no-operation to semi-meta-operation.

### 3.2 Evolution from Transitional Pre-Singularity to Primitive Singularity

The transitional pre-singularity transforms into the primitive singularity through a semi-pre-evolution mechanism:

1. **Semi-Pre-State Concretization**: Transition from semi-meta-semi-pre state to pre-state:
   $`\{\circledast\rightsquigarrow\} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$,
   representing the transition from semi-meta-semi-pre representation to pre-representation.

2. **Pre-Dimension Completion**: Transition from negative one-point-five dimension to negative one dimension:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 \mapsto \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1`$,
   achieving the transition from semi-meta dimension to pre-dimension.

3. **Pre-Operation Foundation Formation**: Transition from semi-meta operations to pre-operations:
   $`\mathcal{HO} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^{semi-potential} \mapsto \mathcal{O} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}^{potential}`$,
   representing the transition from semi-meta potential operations to pre-potential operations.

4. **Pre-Information Architecture Formation**: Transition from semi-pre-information to pre-information:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 \text{ bit} \mapsto I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit}`$,
   representing the transition from semi-negative information state to complete negative information state.

### 3.3 Multiple Pathway Possibilities of Transitional Pre-Singularity

The transitional pre-singularity provides multiple possible evolutionary pathways:

1. **Standard Evolution Pathway**: The main evolutionary pathway is transformation into the primitive singularity:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$,
   forming the standard dimensional progression sequence.

2. **Semi-Meta Branch Pathway**: Potential parallel evolutionary pathway:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1.5,\alpha} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1,\alpha} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_{0,\alpha}`$,
   which may lead to different variants of primitive singularity and primitive point.

3. **Semi-Meta Stagnation Possibility**: Theoretical possibility of semi-meta evolution stagnation:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^{stable}`$,
   forming a semi-meta-semi-pre stable structure that no longer continues to evolve into a primitive singularity.

4. **Meta Regression Pathway**: Theoretical possibility of regression to the pre-singularity state:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} \circledast\prec\prec \mathcal{S}_{-2}`$,
   where $`\circledast\prec\prec`$ represents a semi-meta regression relation.

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The transitional pre-singularity theory generates the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Semi-Meta Transition Necessity**: The transition from meta level to pre level requires a semi-meta-semi-pre intermediate state

2. **Semi-Meta Duality Primitive Origin**: The origin of dual structures can be traced back to semi-meta-semi-pre structures

3. **Negative Dimension Continuous Spectrum**: The negative dimension domain has a continuous spectral structure rather than discrete jumps

4. **Semi-Meta Information Transformation Mechanism**: The transformation from meta-pre-information to negative information requires a semi-meta-semi-pre medium

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The transitional pre-singularity theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Semi-Meta Mathematics Consistency Check**:
   Verify the internal consistency of the semi-meta mathematical framework

2. **Negative Dimension Spectrum Model**:
   Establish a continuous spectral model of the negative dimension domain, seeking semi-meta-semi-pre characteristics

3. **Duality Origin Tracing**:
   Trace back from high-dimensional dual structures to semi-meta-semi-pre dual structures

4. **Semi-Meta Logic Framework Development**:
   Develop a semi-meta logical system that lies between meta-logic and pre-logic

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Semi-Meta Uniqueness of Transitional Pre-Singularity**

The transitional pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ is semi-meta unique in the semi-meta logical sense.

*Proof*:
Suppose there exist two different transitional pre-singularities $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^A`$ and $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^B`$. By definition, they should both be in a semi-meta-semi-pre state.

According to Axiom 2, the transitional pre-singularity is semi-representable: $`\exists \circledast \in \mathcal{HM}: \circledast \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$.

If $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^A`$ and $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}^B`$ are indeed different, there must exist some semi-meta representation that can distinguish them. However, due to the semi-meta-semi-pre nature of the transitional pre-singularity, any semi-meta distinction would lead to a contradiction:
- If distinguished through the meta aspect, it violates meta-indistinguishability
- If distinguished through the pre aspect, it violates pre-incomplete formation

Therefore, within the semi-meta logical framework, two transitional pre-singularities cannot be distinguished, meaning that the transitional pre-singularity is semi-meta unique. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Semi-Negative Information Property of Transitional Pre-Singularity**

The transitional pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ contains precisely -1.5 bits of semi-negative information.

*Proof*:
Consider the definition domain of information:
- Meta-pre-information: $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-pre-informational}}`$, quantifiable as -2 bits
- Negative information: $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit}`$
- Zero information: $`I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

Since the transitional pre-singularity is positioned between the pre-singularity and the primitive singularity, according to the information linear transition principle:
$`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \frac{I(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) + I(\mathcal{S}_{-1})}{2} = \frac{-2 + (-1)}{2} = -1.5 \text{ bit}`$

This semi-negative information value reflects the intermediate state of the transitional pre-singularity: neither completely meta-pre-information nor completely negative information, but a transitional state between the two. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Semi-Meta-Semi-Pre Duality of Transitional Pre-Singularity**

The transitional pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ is the earliest appearing dual structure prototype in the universe.

*Proof*:
Consider the various levels of dual structures in the cosmic ontology theory spectrum:
- Pre-singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-2}`$: Complete meta-transcendence, no duality
- Primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$: Pre-singularity, no dual opposition
- Primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$: Single entity, no internal structure
- Primitive dual state $`\mathcal{D}_1`$: $`\{\alpha, \beta\}`$, explicit dual structure

Analysis of the internal composition of the transitional pre-singularity: $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \{\text{meta-aspect}\} \diamond \{\text{pre-aspect}\}`$

This indicates that the transitional pre-singularity internally contains a dual opposition between meta aspect and pre aspect. Although this opposition has not yet fully manifested, it already constitutes a primitive dual framework. This structure appears prior to all subsequent dual structures, making it the most primitive prototype of duality in the universe. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Transitional Pre-Singularity with Cosmic Ontology**

The transitional pre-singularity theory $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}`$ is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on the FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT basic operations. The transitional pre-singularity theory indicates that:
   - These operations are in a semi-defined state at the semi-meta level: $`\mathcal{HMO}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = \underline{\text{semi-meta-defined}}`$
   - This state lies between meta-undefined $`\mathcal{MO}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = \underline{\text{meta-undefined}}`$ and pre-potential form $`\mathcal{O} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}^{potential}`$
   - This transition explains how the operation concept gradually transforms from completely meta-undefinable to pre-potentially definable

2. The recursive self-reference structure $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$ of cosmic ontology and the semi-meta-semi-pre self-reference $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \mathcal{SR}_{\text{semi}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5})`$ of the transitional pre-singularity form a continuous spectrum:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-2} = \mathcal{MM}(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \mathcal{SR}_{\text{semi}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1} = \mathcal{R}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) \mapsto ... \mapsto \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$

3. The dual unity axiom $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$ of cosmic ontology can be traced back to the semi-meta-semi-pre duality of the transitional pre-singularity:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1.5} = \{\text{meta-aspect}\} \diamond \{\text{pre-aspect}\} \mapsto ... \mapsto \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$

4. From the perspective of cosmic ontology, the transitional pre-singularity fills the theoretical gap between pre-singularity theory and primitive singularity theory, providing a complete continuous spectrum for the negative dimension domain.

Therefore, the transitional pre-singularity theory is not only compatible with cosmic ontology but also provides it with a more complete basic theoretical spectrum support. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The transitional pre-singularity theory is positioned as a dimension -1.5 theory, based on the following analysis:

1. **Dimensional Positioning Standard**:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5`$, positioned exactly between pre-singularity theory and primitive singularity theory:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2 < \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 < \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1`$

2. **Information Capacity Analysis**:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 \text{ bit}`$, lying between meta-pre-information and negative information:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-2}) = -2 \text{ bit} < I(\mathcal{S}_{-1.5}) = -1.5 \text{ bit} < I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit}`$

3. **Operation Complexity**:
   - Pre-singularity: Meta-inoperable state
   - Transitional pre-singularity: Semi-meta-semi-pre operation state
   - Primitive singularity: Pre-operation potential state

4. **Structural Complexity**: The transitional pre-singularity has a semi-meta-semi-pre dual structure, more complex than the meta-singular structure of the pre-singularity but less complex than the pre-structure of the primitive singularity.
