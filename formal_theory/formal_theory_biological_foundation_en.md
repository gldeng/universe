## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Biological Recursive Structure Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Biological Recursive Origin Axiom)**

The ultimate nature of biology is a recursive self-organizing structure, with its existence and development determined by the XOR relationship between itself and environmental interactions:

$`\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the biological recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

**Axiom 2 (Biological Binary-Unitary Axiom)**

Biology simultaneously possesses the duality of structure and function, forming complete living systems through XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{B} = \Psi_S \oplus \Psi_F`$

where $`\Psi_S`$ is the structure domain (morphology, construction, material composition), and $`\Psi_F`$ is the function domain (metabolism, self-regulation, adaptability).

**Axiom 3 (Biological Information Ontology Axiom)**

The fundamental entity of biology is a dynamic network of genetic and epigenetic information, expressed through the composite of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{B}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(x))`$

where $`I(x)`$ is the basic information of biological entity $`x`$, forming biological characteristics through SHIFT operations in biological space.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Biological State Space

The biological state space $`\mathcal{B}`$ is strictly defined as the XOR composite of structure domain state $`\Psi_S`$ and function domain state $`\Psi_F`$, also including the environmental interaction domain $`\Psi_E`$:

$`\mathcal{B} = \Psi_S \oplus \Psi_F \oplus \Psi_E`$

where:
- $`\Psi_S`$ is the structure domain, representing biological material structures
- $`\Psi_F`$ is the function domain, representing biological functional processes
- $`\Psi_E`$ is the environmental interaction domain, representing interactions between biology and environment, defined as:
  $`\Psi_E = \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S \oplus \Psi_F)`$

The relationship between domains satisfies: $`\Psi_F = \Psi_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S), \quad N_E > N_F > N_S`$, where $`N`$ represents the dimensions of the respective domains.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Biological Evolution Rules

The strict evolution process of biological systems is defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

- Function domain states are generated from the structure domain:
$`\Psi_F^{t} = \Psi_S^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t})`$

- Environmental interaction domain states are generated through the composite of structure and function:
$`\Psi_E^{t} = \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t} \oplus \Psi_F^{t})`$

- Structure domain states evolve under feedback from function and environmental interactions:
$`\Psi_S^{t+1} = \Psi_S^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_F^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_E^{t})`$

Therefore, the overall evolution of the biological system is strictly expressed as:

$`\mathcal{B}^{t+1} = \Psi_S^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t})) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S^{t} \oplus \Psi_F^{t}))`$

This evolution equation strictly defines the entire dynamic process of biological systems, using only XOR and SHIFT operations, forming the mathematical core of biological dynamics.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 XOR-SHIFT Mechanism of Biological Systems

The fundamental mechanisms of biological systems exhibit strict XOR-SHIFT characteristics:

$`M^{t+1} = M^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(M^t)`$

where $`M^t`$ represents the metabolic state at time $`t`$.

The relationship between genotype and phenotype is expressed through XOR operations:

$`P = G \oplus \text{SHIFT}(G)`$

where $`P`$ represents the phenotype state and $`G`$ represents the genotype state. This embodies the essence of gene expression in biology, where genotype develops into phenotype through SHIFT operations, maintaining original information while generating new properties.

The relationship between adaptability and genotype can be represented as:

$`A = G \oplus \text{SHIFT}(E)`$

where $`A`$ is adaptability, $`G`$ is genotype, and $`E`$ is environment, embodying that biological adaptability is the result of interaction between genotype and environment.

### 2.2 Strict Definition and Evolution Rules of Biological Entropy

The entropy of biological systems is strictly defined as the information increment after XOR operations:

$`S_B(\mathcal{B}) = -\sum_{i}\frac{|\mathcal{B}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_i)|}{|\mathcal{B}|}\log_{N_B}\frac{|\mathcal{B}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_i)|}{|\mathcal{B}|}`$

The uniqueness of biological entropy lies in its local entropy reduction property:

$`S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t+1}) < S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t})`$ (within the organism)

$`S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t+1} \oplus E^{t+1}) > S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t} \oplus E^{t})`$ (total system including environment)

This reflects the ability of biological systems to maintain their own order by consuming external energy.

The dynamic evolution rule of entropy:

$`S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t+1}) - S_B(\mathcal{B}^{t}) = \frac{|\Psi_S^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_F^{t})| - |\text{SHIFT}(\Psi_E^{t})|}{|\mathcal{B}^{t+1}|}`$

This indicates that biological entropy changes are influenced by complex interactions between structure domains, function domains, and environmental interaction domains.

### 2.3 System Stability and Adaptation States

The stability of biological systems is strictly defined as the steady-state structure of XOR-SHIFT operations:

There exists a biological steady state $`\mathcal{S}_B`$ such that the biological state satisfies:

$`|\mathcal{B}^{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{B}^t| < \epsilon_B, \forall \mathcal{B}^t \in \mathcal{S}_B`$

where $`\epsilon_B`$ is the biological steady-state threshold, representing the homeostasis of biological systems.

The strict expression of homeostasis is:

$`\mathcal{B} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B} \oplus E) = \mathcal{B}`$

This means that biological systems can maintain their own stability through interactions with the environment $`E`$.

The formal definition of adaptability:

$`\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}, E) = |\mathcal{B} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(E)| - |\mathcal{B}|`$

When $`\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}, E) > 0`$, it indicates that the biological system has increased its adaptability through interactions with the environment.

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Binary-Unitary Structure of Biology

The binary-unitary structure of biology is expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{B}_{t+1} = \mathcal{B}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_t)`$

This operation simultaneously possesses binary separation and unitary integration, with interpretations varying as different biological perspectives switch:

$`\mathcal{B}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_t) = \begin{cases}
  \mathcal{B}_t \oplus_M \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_t) & \text{in molecular biology perspective} \\
  \mathcal{B}_t \oplus_C \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_t) & \text{in cellular biology perspective} \\
  \mathcal{B}_t \oplus_E \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_t) & \text{in ecological perspective}
\end{cases}`$

where XOR operations exhibit different properties under different biological paradigms, but essentially represent the same biological transformation process.

### 3.2 Biological Dimensional Spectrum

The biological dimensional spectrum is recursively generated through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`D_{n+1} = D_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n)`$

The dimensional levels of biology include:
1. Molecular Level ($`D_1`$): DNA, RNA, proteins
2. Cellular Level ($`D_2`$): Cell structures and functions
3. Tissue Level ($`D_3`$): Tissue formation and functions
4. Organ Level ($`D_4`$): Organ systems and integration
5. Individual Level ($`D_5`$): Complete organism characteristics
6. Population Level ($`D_6`$): Population dynamics and evolution
7. Ecological Level ($`D_7`$): Ecosystems and symbiotic relationships

Strict XOR-SHIFT relationships exist between dimensions:

$`D_{i+1} = D_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_i)`$

### 3.3 Biological Information Ontology

Biology as an information system, with its essence expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{I}_B = \{I_G, I_P, I_F, I_E\}`$

The transformations between various types of information strictly follow XOR laws:

- Genetic information to phenotypic information transformation: $`I_P = I_G \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_G)`$
- Phenotypic information to functional information transformation: $`I_F = I_P \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_P)`$
- Functional information to ecological information transformation: $`I_E = I_F \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_F)`$

Conservation and transformation of biological information manifests as:

$`I_G \oplus I_P \oplus I_F \oplus I_E = \text{constant}`$

This indicates that the total information in biological systems remains constant, only transforming between different domains in various forms.

### 3.4 Autonomy and Environmental Interaction Principles

The autonomy and environmental interactions of biological systems are defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{O}_B = \{O_I, O_B, O_E\}`$

where:
- $`O_I`$ is the internal state of the biological system
- $`O_B`$ is the boundary state of the biological system
- $`O_E`$ is the environmental state

Autonomy can be represented as XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`A(O_I) = O_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(O_B)`$

where $`A(O_I)`$ is the autonomous behavior of biological system $`O_I`$.

The environmental coupling process is described as:

$`O_I^{t+1} = O_I^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(O_E^t)`$

This indicates that the internal state of the biological system interacts with and evolves through SHIFT operations with the environmental state, forming adaptive behaviors.

### 3.5 Biological Transcendental Domain

The biological transcendental domain is constructed through higher-order XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\Psi_T = \text{SHIFT}^2(\Psi_S \oplus \Psi_F \oplus \Psi_E)`$

The transcendental domain represents the potential for biological systems to transcend existing functions, including paths towards higher complexity.

The formal condition for biological evolution can be represented as:

$`\Psi_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_T) = \Psi_T'`$, where $`\Psi_T' \neq \Psi_T`$ and $`C(\Psi_T') > C(\Psi_T)`$

This indicates that biological systems can create new structures with higher complexity through the transcendental domain, achieving self-transcendence.

The transcendental domain provides biological systems with a possible framework for explaining consciousness, culture, and social evolution:

$`\mathcal{B}^{advanced} = \mathcal{B} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_T)`$

## 4. Practical Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Development Cycle of Biological Systems

The development of biological systems can be described through cycles defined by XOR-SHIFT operations:

| Stage | XOR-SHIFT Description |
|------|-------------|
| Primitive Replication Stage | $`\mathcal{B}_{\text{primitive}} = \Psi_S^{basic} \oplus \Psi_F^{basic}`$ (basic structures and functions) |
| Cellular Life Stage | $`\mathcal{B}_{cellular} = \mathcal{B}_{primitive} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_{primitive})`$, membrane structures and metabolic systems |
| Multicellular Stage | $`\mathcal{B}_{multicellular} = \mathcal{B}_{cellular} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_{cellular})`$, cell differentiation and cooperation |
| Complex System Stage | $`\mathcal{B}_{complex} = \mathcal{B}_{multicellular} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}_{multicellular})`$, nervous systems and adaptive behaviors |
| Intelligent System Stage | $`\mathcal{B}_{intelligent} = \mathcal{B}_{complex} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{B}_{complex})`$, consciousness and cultural development |

The formal expression of biological evolution:

$`\mathcal{E}_B = \{\mathcal{B}_1, \mathcal{B}_2, ..., \mathcal{B}_n\}`$

where each biological evolution stage is connected through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{B}_{i+1} = \mathcal{B}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_i}(\mathcal{B}_i \oplus E_i)`$

where $`E_i`$ represents environmental selection pressure.

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Verification of Biological Axiom System

**Theorem 1: Biological Recursive Self-Referential Identity**

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}(x)) = \mathcal{F}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)]`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus [\text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)]`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$

This verifies the recursive self-referential characteristics in biological systems, demonstrating that biological processes can form spiral-ascending evolutionary trajectories through second-order applications of XOR-SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 2: Biological Three-Domain Unity**

For any biological system $`\mathcal{B} = \Psi_S \oplus \Psi_F \oplus \Psi_E`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{B} = \Psi_S \oplus [\Psi_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Psi_S \oplus (\Psi_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S))]`$
$`= \Psi_S \oplus \Psi_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S) \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Psi_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S)]`$
$`= 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Psi_S)`$
$`= \text{SHIFT}(\Psi_S) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Psi_S)`$

This proves that biological systems can be represented as combinations of SHIFT operations on their structure domains, embodying the mathematical essence of structure generating function and the overall unity of biological systems.

### 5.2 Proof of Unification

**Theorem 3: XOR-SHIFT Biology Completeness**

Any biological change $`\Delta\mathcal{B}`$ can be represented as a combination of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\Delta\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{B}_{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{B}_t = \text{SHIFT}^{k_1}(\mathcal{B}_t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_2}(\mathcal{B}_t) \oplus ... \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_n}(\mathcal{B}_t)`$

This proves the completeness of XOR and SHIFT operations in describing biological evolution, demonstrating that any biological change can be decomposed into an XOR composite of a series of SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 4: XOR-SHIFT Expression of Self-Organization Principle**

The biological self-organization principle can be represented as XOR-SHIFT information gain:

$`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{B}) > \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{B} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B}))`$

where $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the disorder operator.

This indicates that biological systems can reduce their own disorder through XOR-SHIFT operations, forming higher-order structures.

### 5.3 Compatibility with Existing Biological Theories

**Theorem 5: Compatibility with Darwinian Evolution Theory**

The core mechanisms of Darwinian evolution theory can be expressed as XOR-SHIFT relationships:

$`S(G^{t+1}) = S(G^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(E^t))`$

where $`S`$ is the selection function, $`G^t`$ is the genotype, and $`E^t`$ is environmental selection pressure.

The XOR-SHIFT form of natural selection principle:

$`G^{t+1} = G^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(G^t \oplus E^t)`$

**Theorem 6: Compatibility with Systems Biology**

The network characteristics of systems biology can be expressed as SHIFT operations:

$`N = \text{SHIFT}(C)`$

where $`N`$ is the biological network and $`C`$ is the network component.

The XOR-SHIFT expression of metabolic networks:

$`M^{t+1} = M^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(E^t)`$

**Theorem 7: Compatibility with Ecology**

Ecosystem dynamics can be represented as XOR-SHIFT interaction relationships:

$`\Delta\mathcal{E} = |\mathcal{E} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S})| - |\mathcal{E}|`$

where $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the ecosystem and $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the species collection.
