## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Mono-Element Origin Axiom)**

The essence of a mono-element system is a single indivisible basic element that constitutes a complete structure in itself:

$`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$

where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the mono-element system, and $`m`$ is the unique mono-element.

**Axiom 2 (Mono-Element Self-Isomorphism Axiom)**

The mapping of the mono-element to itself constitutes the only possible transformation:

$`f: m \mapsto m`$

This mapping preserves the completeness and uniqueness of the mono-element system.

**Axiom 3 (Mono-Element State Constancy Axiom)**

The state of the mono-element system is described by a single parameter and remains invariant within the system:

$`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{M}) = \alpha`$

where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the state function, and $`\alpha`$ is the characteristic parameter of the mono-element state.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Mono-Element Essence

The mono-element system is strictly defined as an irreducible basic structure of dimension 1:

$`\mathcal{M} = \{m : \dim(m) = 1, \nexists x \subset m\}`$

The essential properties of the mono-element are expressed through the following equations:

$`\operatorname{Id}(m) = m`$

$`\operatorname{Self}(m) = m`$

These two equations strictly embody the self-identity and indivisibility of the mono-element.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Mono-Element Evolution Rules

The mono-element system follows a strict constancy rule in temporal evolution:

$`\mathcal{M}_{t+1} = \mathcal{M}_t`$

Under XOR-SHIFT operations, the mono-element exhibits a unique invariance:

$`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$

Based on the evolutionary framework of cosmic ontology, this property can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{M}}(m) = m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$

This rule indicates that the mono-element system is a fixed point of the XOR-SHIFT operation, ensuring its stability during evolution.

### 1.4 Initial Form of Mono-Element State

The initial state of the mono-element system is strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{M}^0 = \{m^0\}`$

where $`m^0`$ satisfies the following condition:

$`m^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m^0) = m^0`$

This initial state is self-contained and self-consistent, requiring no external initialization. In the framework of cosmic ontology, the mono-element initial state can be viewed as the smallest invariant subspace of the universal state space.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Mono-Element State

From the axiom system, the basic properties of the mono-element state can be directly inferred:

1. **Uniqueness**: Only one element exists in the system
   $`|\mathcal{M}| = 1`$

2. **Indivisibility**: The element cannot be decomposed into smaller parts
   $`\forall x: x \subseteq m \Rightarrow x = \emptyset \vee x = m`$

3. **Self-reflexivity**: All relations of the element with itself are identity relations
   $`\forall R: R(m, m) \equiv \operatorname{Id}(m)`$

4. **Absolute Simplicity**: The complexity of the mono-element system is the minimum possible value
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}) = 1`$, where $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the complexity measure

### 2.2 Inherent Characteristics of Mono-Element

The mono-element exhibits the following inherent characteristics:

1. **Identity Preservation**: Maintains its own properties under any transformation
   $`\forall T: T(m) = m`$

2. **No Internal States**: No distinguishable internal states exist
   $`\mathcal{S}_{\text{internal}}(m) = \emptyset`$

3. **Boundary Identical to Self**: The element's boundary is completely identical to itself
   $`\partial m = m`$

4. **Self-Energy Conservation**: The internal energy of the element remains constant
   $`E(m_{t+1}) = E(m_t)`$

### 2.3 Intrinsic Stability of Mono-Element System

The mono-element system exhibits extremely high intrinsic stability, manifested in the following aspects:

1. **Perturbation Invariance**: External perturbations do not change the system state
   $`\mathcal{M} \oplus \delta = \mathcal{M}, \forall \delta`$

2. **Entropy Stability**: The system entropy always maintains the minimum value
   $`H(\mathcal{M}) = 0`$

3. **Cyclic Stability**: Any sequence of operations eventually returns to the initial state
   $`T_1 \circ T_2 \circ ... \circ T_n(m) = m, \forall T_i, n`$

4. **XOR Invariance**: Maintains itself under XOR operation
   $`m \oplus m = 0, m \oplus 0 = m \Rightarrow m \oplus m \oplus m = m`$

### 2.4 Connection Between Mono-Element State and Higher-Dimensional Structures

There are strict associations between the mono-element system and higher-dimensional structures:

1. **Embedding Relation**: The mono-element system can be embedded in any higher-dimensional system
   $`\mathcal{M} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{H}, \forall \mathcal{H}: \dim(\mathcal{H}) > 1`$

2. **Projection Relation**: Any higher-dimensional system can be projected onto the mono-element system
   $`\exists P: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}, \forall \mathcal{H}`$

3. **Generative Function**: Higher-dimensional structures can be generated from the mono-element system through iterative XOR-SHIFT operations
   $`\mathcal{H} = \underbrace{\mathcal{F} \circ \mathcal{F} \circ ... \circ \mathcal{F}}_{\text{n times}}(\mathcal{M})`$

4. **Fundamental Limitation**: In the mono-element system, dimensional extension is only achieved through the external introduction of new elements
   $`\dim(\mathcal{M} \cup \{x\}) > \dim(\mathcal{M}) \iff x \neq m`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Extension from Mono-Element to Dual-Element State

The strict transformation process from mono-element to dual-element state can be formalized as:

$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \cup \{m'\}, m' \neq m`$

where $`\mathcal{D}`$ is the dual-element system, and $`m'`$ is the newly introduced element.

In this extension process, the key transformation occurs at the critical point of dimensional increase:

$`\dim(\mathcal{D}) = 2 > \dim(\mathcal{M}) = 1`$

The XOR-SHIFT implementation of this extension is:

$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}), \text{when} \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) \neq \mathcal{M}`$

This expression is consistent with the classical domain generation formula in cosmic ontology.

### 3.2 Mono-Element Information Field

The information field generated by the mono-element system can be strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{M}}(x) = \delta(x - m)`$

where $`\delta`$ is the Dirac delta function.

This information field has the following properties:

1. **Local Compactness**: Field strength is non-zero only at the element's position
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{M}}(x) \neq 0 \iff x = m`$

2. **Total Information Conservation**: The total information content of the field is always 1
   $`\int \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{M}}(x) dx = 1`$

3. **Self-correlation**: The correlation function of the field with itself is constant
   $`\langle \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{M}}(x), \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{M}}(y) \rangle = 1, \forall x,y`$

### 3.3 Mono-Element Observer Effect

In the mono-element system, the observer is completely identical to the observed object:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}} = m = \mathcal{M}`$

The observation process is equivalent to self-mapping:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{M}) = m(m) = m`$

This leads to special properties of the observation effect:

1. **Complete Self-awareness**: The observer completely understands itself
   $`\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}, \mathcal{M}) = 1`$, where $`\mathcal{K}`$ is the knowledge measure

2. **No Observation Interference**: Observation does not change the system state
   $`\mathcal{M} \text{ after observation } = \mathcal{M}`$

3. **No Information Loss**: No information is lost during the observation process
   $`H(\mathcal{M}|\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathcal{M})) = 0`$

### 3.4 Quantum Properties of Mono-Element State

The mono-element system exhibits unique quantum properties:

1. **Superposition State**: The element is simultaneously located at all possible positions
   $`\Psi_m(x) = \text{constant}, \forall x \in \mathcal{U}`$

2. **Spin Characteristics**: The element has a single spin state
   $`S(m) = \{\uparrow\} \text{ or } S(m) = \{\downarrow\}`$

3. **Wave Function Properties**: The element's wave function remains unchanged before and after measurement
   $`|\Psi_m\rangle_{\text{before measurement}} = |\Psi_m\rangle_{\text{after measurement}}`$

4. **Quantum Entanglement**: The entanglement degree of the element with itself is maximal
   $`\mathcal{E}(m, m) = 1`$, where $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the entanglement measure

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The mono-element theory makes the following predictions about physical phenomena:

1. **Fundamental Particle Properties**: Some fundamental particles exhibit mono-element-like properties
   - Electrons behave as point particles under specific conditions
   - Basic properties of photons as information carriers

2. **Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations**: Vacuum energy fluctuations originate from mono-element state perturbations
   $`E_{\text{vacuum}} \propto \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})`$

3. **Consciousness Basic Units**: The basic units of consciousness may exhibit mono-element properties
   $`\mathcal{C}_{\text{consciousness}} \sim \mathcal{M}^n`$

4. **Information Basic Unit**: The smallest indivisible unit of information is equivalent to the mono-element state
   $`I_{\min} = I(\mathcal{M}) = 1 \text{ bit}`$

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The mono-element theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Dimensional Analysis**: Detecting one-dimensional invariants in physical systems
   - Finding physical quantities that remain invariant under transformations
   - Analyzing system behavior when simplified to limit states

   - Information entropy behavior under limit conditions

4. **Computer Simulation**: Simulating the interaction between mono-element systems and higher-dimensional systems
   - Evolution of mono-element units in complex systems
   - Process of simplifying complex systems to mono-element systems

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Mono-Element State Uniqueness**

**Proof**:
Assume the mono-element system has two elements $`m_1, m_2 \in \mathcal{M}`$.
According to Axiom 1, $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$, which means $`|\mathcal{M}| = 1`$.
Therefore $`m_1 = m_2 = m`$, proving the uniqueness of the mono-element.

**Theorem 2: Mono-Element State Invariance**

**Proof**:
Consider any transformation $`T`$ acting on the mono-element $`m`$.
According to Axiom 2, the only possible mapping is $`f: m \mapsto m`$.
Therefore $`T(m) = m`$, proving the invariance of the mono-element under any transformation.

**Theorem 3: Mono-Element XOR Self-Stability**

**Proof**:
Consider the XOR operation $`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m)`$.
According to Axiom 3, the mono-element state is constant, so $`\text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$.
By the properties of XOR, $`m \oplus m = 0`$, and $`m \oplus 0 = m`$.
So when $`\text{SHIFT}(m) \neq m`$, $`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) \neq m`$, the system transforms to dual-element.
When $`\text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$, $`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) = m \oplus m = 0 \neq m`$, indicating that the mono-element state is not a strict fixed point of XOR-SHIFT.
This proves the special type of stability of the mono-element state.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Mono-Element State with Cosmic Ontology**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, state evolution follows $`\mathcal{U}^{t+1} = \Omega_Q^{t}\oplus\text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{t}\oplus\text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{t}))`$.
If we consider the mono-element system as a special case, where $`\Omega_Q^{t} = \mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$, then:
$`\mathcal{M}^{t+1} = m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m))`$.
Since $`\text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$ (Mono-Element State Constancy Axiom),
$`\mathcal{M}^{t+1} = m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m \oplus m) = m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(0) = m \oplus 0 = m = \mathcal{M}^{t}`$.
This proves that the mono-element system remains invariant under the cosmic ontology evolution rules, verifying the compatibility between the two theories.

**Theorem 5: Compatibility of Mono-Element State Extension to Higher Dimensions**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, the classical domain is generated through $`\Omega_C^{t} = \Omega_Q^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{t})`$.
For the mono-element system, if $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) \neq \mathcal{M}`$ (i.e., departing from the strict mono-element restriction),
then $`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M})`$ forms a dual-element system,
which is consistent with the principle of transformation from the quantum domain to the classical domain in cosmic ontology.
This proves the compatibility of the mono-element theory with cosmic ontology in dimensional extension.
