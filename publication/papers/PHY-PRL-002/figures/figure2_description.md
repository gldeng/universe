## Key Insights

This experimental setup tests a fundamental prediction of the Universe Ontology theory: that certain correlation properties remain preserved under XOR operations with reference states, even in non-local settings. 

The extended Bell-type inequality:
$$|\langle A_1 \oplus R_1, B_1 \rangle + \langle A_1 \oplus R_1, B_2 \rangle + \langle A_2 \oplus R_2, B_1 \rangle - \langle A_2 \oplus R_2, B_2 \rangle| \leq 2$$

According to standard quantum mechanics, this inequality should be violated in a way similar to the standard Bell inequality. However, the Universe Ontology theory predicts that specific combinations of correlation terms will show invariance properties not expected in standard quantum mechanics.

The most significant differences between standard quantum mechanics and Universe Ontology predictions appear when the reference states $R_1$ and $R_2$ are prepared in specific superposition states, highlighting the unique behavior of XOR operations in quantum systems.
