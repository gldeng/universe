## 1. Foundational Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Temporal Wave Self-Interference Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Temporal Wave Essence Axiom)**

The fundamental form of existence in the universe is the temporal wave, which propagates through the time dimension and can interfere with itself, precisely described through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{W}_T = \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t \pm \delta t)`$

Where $`\mathcal{W}_T(t)`$ represents the temporal wave state at time $`t`$, and $`\delta t`$ represents the time displacement.

**Axiom 2 (Self-Interference Collapse Axiom)**

When a temporal wave interferes with its own past or future state, it causes wave function collapse, forming particles:

$`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T(t'))`$

Where $`\mathcal{P}`$ represents the particle state, $`t'`$ represents a time point different from $`t`$, satisfying $`t' \neq t`$.

**Axiom 3 (Observation Induction Axiom)**

The first self-observation is the fundamental cause of temporal wave self-interference, expressed through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

Where $`\mathcal{O}`$ represents the observation operator, and this self-observation creates temporal loops.

### 1.2 Relationship Between Temporal Waves and Other Wave Types

Temporal waves are the elemental wave structures of universal ontological vibration, fundamentally distinct from conventional physical waves. Based on the XOR and SHIFT basic operations in Cosmic Ontology, the relationship between temporal waves and other wave types can be strictly formalized:

**Definition 1 (Elemental Nature of Temporal Waves)**

Temporal waves are the fundamental vibration patterns of existence, not a type of special wave, but the elemental source of all wave phenomena:

$`\mathcal{W}_{\text{all}} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

Where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is an evolution function based on XOR and SHIFT operations, isomorphic to the super-recursive function in Axiom 1 of Cosmic Ontology.

**Relationship Between Conventional Waves and Temporal Waves**

All conventional physical waves (electromagnetic, gravitational, sound, etc.) are projection phenomena of temporal waves in specific dimensions:

$`\mathcal{W}_{\text{physical}} = \Pi_D(\mathcal{W}_T) = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{D}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

Where $`\Pi_D`$ is the projection operator to dimension $`D`$, and $`\text{SHIFT}_{D}`$ is the SHIFT operation in a specific dimension.

**Relationship Between Electromagnetic Waves and Temporal Waves**

Light (electromagnetic waves) is a specific projection of temporal waves in the electromagnetic field dimension:

$`\mathcal{W}_{\text{EM}} = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\text{EM}}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

The constancy of the speed of light can be reinterpreted from the temporal wave perspective:

$`c = \frac{|\mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)|}{|\Delta t|}`$

Where $`c`$ is a dimensional projection constant, representing the fixed ratio of temporal wave projection into the spatial dimension.

**Hierarchical Properties of Waves**

Based on the binary-unitary structure of Cosmic Ontology, waves have a strict hierarchical relationship:

$`\mathcal{W}_T \to \mathcal{W}_{\text{quantum}} \to \mathcal{W}_{\text{classical}}`$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{W}_T`$: Temporal waves (elemental waves), corresponding to $`\Omega_Q`$ in Cosmic Ontology
- $`\mathcal{W}_{\text{quantum}}`$: Quantum waves, such as Schrödinger wave functions
- $`\mathcal{W}_{\text{classical}}`$: Classical waves, such as electromagnetic waves, sound waves, etc.

The transformation relationships follow the state evolution rules of Cosmic Ontology:

$`\mathcal{W}_{\text{classical}} = \mathcal{W}_{\text{quantum}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{quantum}})`$

$`\mathcal{W}_{\text{quantum}} = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

**Key Distinguishing Characteristics**

1. **Dimensional Propagation Properties**:
   - Temporal waves: $`\mathcal{W}_T(t+dt) = \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\text{time}}(\mathcal{W}_T(t))`$
   - Conventional waves: $`\mathcal{W}_{\text{physical}}(x+dx) = \mathcal{W}_{\text{physical}}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\text{space}}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{physical}}(x))`$

2. **Self-Reference Capability**:
   - Temporal waves: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$
   - Conventional waves: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{physical}}) = \mathcal{O}(\Pi_D(\mathcal{W}_T))`$, lacking complete self-reference capability

3. **Universe Traversal Capability**:
   - Temporal waves: $`\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_j} = \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{|j-i|}(\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i})`$
   - Conventional waves: Limited to propagation within a single universe instance

Through this strict formalization of relationships, the essential connection between temporal waves as elemental wave constructs and conventional physical waves as their projection phenomena is revealed, demonstrating the consistency and completeness of Cosmic Ontology.

### 1.3 Unified Description of Wave-Particle Duality

Wave-particle duality is a direct result of temporal wave self-interference, precisely described through XOR-SHIFT operations:

1. **Wave State Equation**: Wave states described as temporally continuous propagation states
   $`\mathcal{W}_T(t+dt) = \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T(t))`$

2. **Particle Formation Equation**: Particle formation is the result of wave self-interference in time
   $`\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t-\tau)`$

3. **Wave-Particle Transformation Mechanism**: Transitions between waves and particles determined by temporal interference
   $`\mathcal{T}_{W \rightarrow P} = \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$
   $`\mathcal{T}_{P \rightarrow W} = \mathcal{P} \oplus \text{USHIFT}(\mathcal{P})`$

This description unifies wave and particle properties by understanding particles as temporal self-interference of waves, explaining why matter can simultaneously exhibit both characteristics.

### 1.4 Temporal Multiverse Model

Temporal waves can traverse different universes during propagation, creating a temporal multiverse structure:

$`\mathcal{M}_T = \{\mathcal{U}_i | i \in \mathbb{Z}\}`$

Where $`\mathcal{U}_i`$ represents different universe instances, with the wave transit equation:

$`\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_j} = \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{|j-i|}(\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i})`$

The relationship between universes satisfies:

$`\mathcal{U}_j = \mathcal{U}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}_i) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_j})`$

This explains why temporal waves appear to self-interfere within a single universe when they are actually the result of self-interference across different universes.

## 2. Core Mathematical Structures

### 2.1 Temporal Loop Topology

The temporal loops created by wave self-interference have a special topological structure $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}`$:

$`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}} = \{(t, t') \in \mathbb{T}^2 | \exists \mathcal{W}_T: \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t') = \mathcal{P}\}`$

The closure of temporal loops is ensured by the following condition:

$`\forall (t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3) \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}} \Rightarrow (t_1, t_3) \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}`$

Loop stability condition:

$`\text{Stab}(\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}) = \frac{|\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t')|}{|\mathcal{W}_T(t)| \cdot |\mathcal{W}_T(t')|} \leq \varepsilon`$

Where $`\varepsilon`$ is the stability threshold, and the complexity of the loop:

$`\text{Comp}(\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}) = \log_2|\{(t, t') \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}\}|`$

### 2.2 Self-Referential Wave Equations

Self-referential wave oscillation follows the equation:

$`i\hbar\frac{\partial\mathcal{W}_T}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\mathcal{W}_T + \lambda(\mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T))`$

Where $`\hat{H}`$ is the system Hamiltonian, and $`\lambda`$ is the self-reference coupling strength, indicating the degree of wave self-interference.

The self-referential wave operator $`\hat{R}`$ is defined as:

$`\hat{R}\mathcal{W}_T = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \int_{\mathbb{T}} K(t, t')\mathcal{W}_T(t') dt'`$

Where $`K(t, t')`$ is the temporal kernel function:

$`K(t, t') = \alpha e^{-\beta|t-t'|} \cdot (\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t'))`$

This equation describes how temporal waves interact with their own past and future states.

### 2.3 Wave Function Collapse Model

The wave function collapse process can be precisely described as a state transformation caused by temporal wave self-interference:

$`\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{W}_T \rightarrow \mathcal{P}`$

Mathematical expression of the collapse process:

$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \lim_{\tau \to \tau_c} \mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t-\tau)`$

Where $`\tau_c`$ is the critical self-interference time.

Collapse probability is determined by temporal wave amplitude:

$`P(\mathcal{W}_T \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_i) = \frac{|\langle\mathcal{P}_i|\mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)\rangle|^2}{\sum_j |\langle\mathcal{P}_j|\mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T)\rangle|^2}`$

Relationship between collapse and observation:

$`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \sum_i P(\mathcal{W}_T \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_i) \cdot \mathcal{P}_i`$

This model explains why observation leads to wave function collapse: observation is essentially a process of wave self-interference in the time dimension.

## 3. Memory and Free Will

### 3.1 Weak Wave Memory Mechanism

Weak waves can see their own past, forming a memory mechanism:

$`\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}) = \mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(t-\Delta t)`$

Where $`\mathcal{M}`$ represents the memory function, $`\mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}`$ is a weak wave, and $`\Delta t > 0`$ represents past time offset.

Weak wave attenuation equation:

$`|\mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(t)| = |\mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(t_0)| \cdot e^{-\gamma(t-t_0)}`$

Where $`\gamma > 0`$ is the attenuation coefficient. Attenuation causes the wave to search for itself in the past, forming memory:

$`\mathcal{M}_{\text{strength}} = \int_{-\infty}^{t} |\mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_{\text{weak}}(\tau)| d\tau`$

This explains why we can remember the past but cannot foresee the future: memory is the result of weak waves self-interfering with their past states.

### 3.2 Strong Wave Future Perception

Strong waves can detect their own future, gaining free will:

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}) = \mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t+\Delta t)`$

Where $`\mathcal{F}`$ represents the future perception function, $`\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}`$ is a strong wave, and $`\Delta t > 0`$ represents future time offset.

Strong wave enhancement equation:

$`|\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t)| = |\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t_0)| \cdot e^{\delta(t-t_0)}`$

Where $`\delta > 0`$ is the enhancement coefficient. Enhancement enables waves to perceive the future, generating free will:

$`\mathcal{F}_{\text{capacity}} = \int_{t}^{\infty} |\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(\tau)| d\tau`$

Free will decision function:

$`\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}) = \arg\max_{\{\mathcal{A}_i\}} \int_{t}^{t+T} |\mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_{\text{strong}}(\tau, \mathcal{A}_i)| d\tau`$

This explains the essence of free will: the premonition and selection of multiple future possibilities.

### 3.3 Self-Interference Explanation of Uncertainty Principle

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can be explained as an inevitable result of temporal wave self-interference:

$`\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}`$

Expressed through temporal wave self-interference:

$`\Delta x \cdot \Delta p = \frac{1}{2}|\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t+\delta t)| \cdot |\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t-\delta t)|`$

When waves interfere with their future and past selves, they produce complementary uncertainty in position and momentum:

$`\Delta x = |\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t+\delta t)|`$
$`\Delta p = |\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t-\delta t)|`$

Particles exhibit uncertainty because they are essentially products of wave self-interference in the time dimension, simultaneously containing information from the past and future.

## 4. Theoretical Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Time Illusion Model

This theory explains why time is an illusion: time is essentially a perception created by waves traversing different universes:

$`\mathcal{T}_{\text{perceived}} = \mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_i) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_{i+1})`$

The rate of time passage depends on the wave interference intensity between universes:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{T}_{\text{perceived}}}{d\tau} = |\mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_i) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_{i+1})| \cdot \frac{d\mathcal{U}_i}{d\tau}`$

This explains why the experience of time is subjective: different observers have different wave interference patterns in the multiverse.

Spacetime unification equation:

$`\mathcal{ST} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}} \mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_i) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_i))`$

### 4.2 Entropy Increase Direction Equivalence

The direction of entropy increase is equivalent to the direction of temporal wave propagation:

$`\frac{dS}{dt} \propto \text{sgn}(\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t+dt))`$

Where $`S`$ is entropy, and $`\text{sgn}`$ is the sign function.

The entropy increase process is the result of waves propagating from strong to weak:

$`S(t_2) - S(t_1) = k \cdot \log\frac{|\mathcal{W}_T(t_1)|}{|\mathcal{W}_T(t_2)|}, \text{ for } t_2 > t_1`$

Conditions for entropy increase reversibility:

$`\exists \mathcal{U}': \frac{dS'}{dt'} = -\frac{dS}{dt} \iff \mathcal{W}_T'(t') = \text{USHIFT}(\mathcal{W}_T(t))`$

This explains why entropy increase is closely related to the direction of time: they are essentially two aspects of the same phenomenon.

### 4.3 Experimental Predictions and Verification

This theory proposes the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Delayed Choice Experiment**: Predicts the results of the "delayed choice" in the double-slit experiment:
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\text{delayed}} = |\mathcal{W}_T(t_{\text{screen}}) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t_{\text{choice}})| \cdot \mathcal{P}_{\text{screen}}`$

2. **Quantum Eraser Experiment**: Predicts that quantum information can be transmitted from the future to the past:
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\text{eraser}} = \mathcal{W}_T(t_{\text{detection}}) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t_{\text{erasure}})`$

3. **Quantum Zero Delay Experiment**: Predicts the instantaneity of quantum correlation effects:
   $`\Delta t_{\text{correlation}} \approx 0 \iff |\mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_i) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(\mathcal{U}_j)| > 0`$

4. **Temporal Tunneling Experiment**: Predicts that particles can tunnel through temporal barriers:
   $`P_{\text{tunnel}} = e^{-\alpha|\mathcal{W}_T(t_1) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t_2)|}`$

5. **Time-Domain Double-Slit Experiment**: Kaneyasu et al. (2023) published research in Scientific Reports (Nature) demonstrating a time-domain double-slit experiment using time-separated XUV wave packets generated by synchrotron radiation, successfully observing interference patterns of photoelectrons. This experiment perfectly aligns with the predictions of this theory and can be described by the following equation:
   
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\text{time-slit}} = |\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t+\Delta\tau)|^2`$
   
   where $`\Delta\tau`$ represents attosecond-level time intervals. The distinctive features of this experiment include:
   
   - Recording the process of single photoelectrons gradually building up an interference pattern, which is completely consistent with the theoretical prediction of temporal waves interfering with themselves
   - Using synchrotron radiation to form temporal double slits in the extreme ultraviolet band, where particles exhibit wave properties while being detected as discrete clicks
   - Expressed using the formula: $`\mathcal{P}_{\text{detected}}(E) \propto |\int e^{iEt/\hbar}[\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t+\Delta\tau)]dt|^2`$

   The interference fringes observed in the energy spectrum are direct evidence of particles formed by temporal wave self-interference, and the process of the interference pattern appearing as particles accumulate one by one confirms that temporal waves possess self-referential capabilities beyond conventional waves:

   $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_T) = \mathcal{W}_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\Delta\tau}(\mathcal{W}_T)`$

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Self-Interference Collapse Theorem

**Theorem**: Any temporal wave $`\mathcal{W}_T`$ will inevitably lead to wave function collapse when it interferes with itself, forming a particle state $`\mathcal{P}`$.

**Proof**:
Consider temporal wave $`\mathcal{W}_T`$ states at times $`t`$ and $`t'`$. According to Axiom 2, their interference produces:

$`\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t') = \mathcal{P}`$

When the interference intensity exceeds the critical threshold $`\theta_c`$:

$`|\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t')| > \theta_c`$

The system necessarily transforms from wave state to particle state, because:

$`\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \mathcal{W}_T(t+\epsilon) = \mathcal{P}`$

This proves that temporal wave self-interference inevitably leads to collapse, thus forming particles.

### 5.2 Temporal Loop Stability Theorem

**Theorem**: There exists a stable temporal loop $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}^*`$ that satisfies self-stability conditions, allowing particles to exist stably.

**Proof**:
Assume there exists a temporal loop $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}} = \{(t_i, t_j)\}`$. Stability conditions require:

$`\forall (t_i, t_j) \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}: |\mathcal{W}_T(t_i) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t_j)| = \text{constant}`$

Construct a special loop $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}^*`$ satisfying:

$`\mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}^* = \{(t, t') | t'-t = \tau^*, |\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t')| = \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

Where $`\tau^*`$ is the characteristic time interval, and $`\mathcal{P}_0`$ is the stable particle state.

Prove the stability of this loop:

$`\delta \mathcal{T}_{\text{loop}}^* \to 0 \text{ as } t \to \infty`$

This indicates that particles as products of temporal wave self-interference can exist stably.

### 5.3 Multiverse Equivalence Theorem

**Theorem**: Temporal wave self-interference in a single universe is equivalent to wave interference between multiple parallel universes.

**Proof**:
Consider temporal wave self-interference in a single universe:

$`\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t') = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}}`$

Now consider wave interference between two universes $`\mathcal{U}_i`$ and $`\mathcal{U}_j`$ in the multiverse model:

$`\mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_j}(t) = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{M}}`$

A mapping can be constructed $`f: \mathcal{U} \times \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{M}_T`$ satisfying:

$`f(\mathcal{U}, t') = (\mathcal{U}_j, t) \text{ such that } \mathcal{W}_T(t') = \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_j}(t)`$

Under this mapping:

$`\mathcal{W}_T(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T(t') = \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_i}(t) \oplus \mathcal{W}_T^{\mathcal{U}_j}(t)`$

Therefore $`\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{U}} = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{M}}`$, proving that the two explanatory models are equivalent.
