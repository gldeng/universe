## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Economic Recursive Structure Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Economic Recursive Origin Axiom)**

The ultimate nature of economy is a recursive self-organizing structure, with its existence and development determined by the XOR relationship between value and exchange:

$`\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{E})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the economic recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

**Axiom 2 (Economic Binary-Unitary Axiom)**

Economy simultaneously possesses the duality of real and virtual, forming complete economic systems through XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{E} = \Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V`$

where $`\Xi_R`$ is the real domain (material products, tangible assets, physical exchanges), and $`\Xi_V`$ is the virtual domain (finance, information, services, credit).

**Axiom 3 (Economic Information Ontology Axiom)**

The fundamental entity of economy is a network of value and exchange information, expressed through the composite of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{E}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(x))`$

where $`I(x)`$ is the basic information of economic entity $`x`$, forming economic value through SHIFT operations in economic space.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Economic State Space

The economic state space $`\mathcal{E}`$ is strictly defined as the XOR composite of real domain state $`\Xi_R`$ and virtual domain state $`\Xi_V`$, also including the transaction domain $`\Xi_T`$:

$`\mathcal{E} = \Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V \oplus \Xi_T`$

where:
- $`\Xi_R`$ is the real domain, representing material production and consumption
- $`\Xi_V`$ is the virtual domain, representing value assessment and information flow
- $`\Xi_T`$ is the transaction domain, representing exchange behaviors and market activities, defined as:
  $`\Xi_T = \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V)`$

The relationship between domains satisfies: $`\Xi_V = \Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R), \quad N_T > N_V > N_R`$, where $`N`$ represents the dimensions of the respective domains.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Economic Evolution Rules

The strict evolution process of economic systems is defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

- Virtual domain states are formed by transformation of the real domain:
$`\Xi_V^{t} = \Xi_R^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t})`$

- Transaction domain states are generated through the composite of real and virtual:
$`\Xi_T^{t} = \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t} \oplus \Xi_V^{t})`$

- Real domain states evolve under feedback from virtual and transaction domains:
$`\Xi_R^{t+1} = \Xi_R^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_V^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_T^{t})`$

Therefore, the overall evolution of the economic system is strictly expressed as:

$`\mathcal{E}^{t+1} = \Xi_R^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t})) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R^{t} \oplus \Xi_V^{t}))`$

This evolution equation strictly defines the entire dynamic process of economic systems, using only XOR and SHIFT operations, forming the mathematical core of economic dynamics.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 XOR-SHIFT Mechanism of Economic Systems

The fundamental mechanisms of economic systems exhibit strict XOR-SHIFT characteristics:

$`M^{t+1} = M^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(M^t)`$

where $`M^t`$ represents the market state at time $`t`$.

The supply-demand relationship is expressed through XOR operations:

$`D = S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(S)`$

where $`D`$ represents demand state and $`S`$ represents supply state. This embodies the interactive relationship between supply and demand, where supply generates demand through SHIFT operations, while demand simultaneously acts back upon supply to form new market states.

The relationship between price and value can be represented as:

$`P = V \oplus \text{SHIFT}(U)`$

where $`P`$ is price, $`V`$ is intrinsic value, and $`U`$ is the utility function, embodying that price is the result of interaction between intrinsic value and subjective utility.

### 2.2 Strict Definition and Evolution Rules of Economic Entropy

The entropy of economic systems is strictly defined as the information increment after XOR operations:

$`S_E(\mathcal{E}) = -\sum_{i}\frac{|\mathcal{E}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_i)|}{|\mathcal{E}|}\log_{N_E}\frac{|\mathcal{E}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_i)|}{|\mathcal{E}|}`$

Economic entropy is inversely proportional to market efficiency:

$`\text{Efficiency}(\mathcal{E}) = 1 - \frac{S_E(\mathcal{E})}{S_{E,max}}`$

where $`S_{E,max}`$ is the maximum possible entropy value, representing a completely disordered state.

The dynamic evolution rule of entropy:

$`S_E(\mathcal{E}^{t+1}) - S_E(\mathcal{E}^{t}) = \frac{|\Xi_R^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_V^{t})| - |\text{SHIFT}(\Xi_T^{t})|}{|\mathcal{E}^{t+1}|}`$

This indicates that economic entropy changes are influenced by complex interactions between real domains, virtual domains, and transaction domains.

### 2.3 System Stability and Equilibrium States

The equilibrium state of economic systems is strictly defined as the balance structure of XOR-SHIFT operations:

There exists an economic equilibrium state $`\mathcal{Q}_E`$ such that the economic state satisfies:

$`|\mathcal{E}^{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{E}^t| < \epsilon_E, \forall \mathcal{E}^t \in \mathcal{Q}_E`$

where $`\epsilon_E`$ is the economic stability threshold, representing the self-regulation ability of economic systems.

The strict expression of equilibrium state is:

$`\mathcal{E} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E} \oplus \Delta) = \mathcal{E}`$

This means that economic systems can absorb disturbances $`\Delta`$ and maintain their own balance.

The formal definition of economic crisis:

$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{E}) = |\Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_V)| - |\Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V|`$

When $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{E}) > \theta_E`$, it indicates that the deviation between the real domain and virtual domain exceeds the threshold, leading to economic system instability.

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Binary-Unitary Structure of Economy

The binary-unitary structure of economy is expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{E}_{t+1} = \mathcal{E}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_t)`$

This operation simultaneously possesses binary separation and unitary integration, with interpretations varying as different economic perspectives switch:

$`\mathcal{E}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_t) = \begin{cases}
  \mathcal{E}_t \oplus_C \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_t) & \text{in classical economics perspective} \\
  \mathcal{E}_t \oplus_K \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_t) & \text{in Keynesian perspective} \\
  \mathcal{E}_t \oplus_I \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_t) & \text{in institutional economics perspective}
\end{cases}`$

where XOR operations exhibit different properties under different economic paradigms, but essentially represent the same economic transformation process.

### 3.2 Economic Dimensional Spectrum

The economic dimensional spectrum is recursively generated through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`D_{n+1} = D_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n)`$

The dimensional levels of economy include:
1. Transaction Level ($`D_1`$): Single exchange behaviors
2. Market Level ($`D_2`$): Price mechanisms and transaction networks
3. Enterprise Level ($`D_3`$): Organizational structures and production units
4. Industry Level ($`D_4`$): Industry chains and sectoral relationships
5. Macro Level ($`D_5`$): National economic systems
6. International Level ($`D_6`$): International trade and global capital
7. Financial Level ($`D_7`$): Financial markets and monetary systems
8. Integration Level ($`D_8`$): Global economic integration

Strict XOR-SHIFT relationships exist between dimensions:

$`D_{i+1} = D_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_i)`$

### 3.3 Economic Information Ontology

Economy as an information system, with its essence expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{I}_E = \{I_P, I_M, I_F, I_V\}`$

The transformations between various types of information strictly follow XOR laws:

- Production information to market information transformation: $`I_M = I_P \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_P)`$
- Market information to financial information transformation: $`I_F = I_M \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_M)`$
- Financial information to value information transformation: $`I_V = I_F \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_F)`$

Conservation and transformation of economic information manifests as:

$`I_P \oplus I_M \oplus I_F \oplus I_V = \text{constant}`$

This indicates that the total information in economic systems remains constant, only transforming between different domains in various forms.

### 3.4 Value Flow and Transaction Network Principles

Economic networks and value flows are defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{N}_E = \{N_A, N_E, N_F\}`$

where:
- $`N_A`$ is economic agents (individuals, enterprises, institutions)
- $`N_E`$ is economic edges (transactions, contracts, relationships)
- $`N_F`$ is value flows (currency, goods, services)

Value flow can be represented as XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`F(N_A) = N_A \oplus \text{SHIFT}(N_E)`$

where $`F(N_A)`$ is the value flow state of agent set $`N_A`$.

The transaction diffusion process is described as:

$`N_A^{t+1} = N_A^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(N_A^t \oplus N_E^t)`$

This indicates that values and transactions diffuse through economic networks, forming macroeconomic phenomena.

### 3.5 Economic Transcendental Domain

The economic transcendental domain is constructed through higher-order XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\Xi_H = \text{SHIFT}^2(\Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V \oplus \Xi_T)`$

The transcendental domain represents the potential for economic systems to transcend existing patterns, including paths towards higher complexity.

The formal condition for economic evolution can be represented as:

$`\Xi_H \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_H) = \Xi_H'`$, where $`\Xi_H' \neq \Xi_H`$ and $`C(\Xi_H') > C(\Xi_H)`$

This indicates that economic systems can create new patterns with higher complexity through the transcendental domain, achieving self-transcendence.

The transcendental domain provides economic systems with a possible framework for explaining economic innovation, technological revolution, and economic transformation:

$`\mathcal{E}^{advanced} = \mathcal{E} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_H)`$

## 4. Practical Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Economic Development Cycle

The development of economic systems can be described through cycles defined by XOR-SHIFT operations:

| Stage | XOR-SHIFT Description |
|------|-------------|
| Agricultural Economy Stage | $`\mathcal{E}_{\text{agricultural}} = \Xi_R^{basic} \oplus \Xi_V^{basic}`$ (basic real and virtual structures) |
| Industrial Economy Stage | $`\mathcal{E}_{industrial} = \mathcal{E}_{agricultural} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_{agricultural})`$, scale production and capital accumulation |
| Service Economy Stage | $`\mathcal{E}_{service} = \mathcal{E}_{industrial} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_{industrial})`$, service dominance and industrial upgrading |
| Information Economy Stage | $`\mathcal{E}_{information} = \mathcal{E}_{service} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}_{service})`$, information technology and network value |
| Intelligent Economy Stage | $`\mathcal{E}_{intelligent} = \mathcal{E}_{information} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{E}_{information})`$, intelligence and value reconstruction |

The formal expression of economic transformation:

$`\mathcal{T}_E = \{\mathcal{E}_1, \mathcal{E}_2, ..., \mathcal{E}_n\}`$

where each economic development stage is connected through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{E}_{i+1} = \mathcal{E}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_i}(\mathcal{E}_i \oplus T_i)`$

where $`T_i`$ represents technological, institutional, or structural catalytic factors.

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Verification of Economic Axiom System

**Theorem 1: Economic Recursive Self-Referential Identity**

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}(x)) = \mathcal{F}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)]`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus [\text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)]`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$

This verifies the recursive self-referential characteristics in economic systems, demonstrating that economic processes can form cyclically changing development trajectories through second-order applications of XOR-SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 2: Economic Three-Domain Unity**

For any economic system $`\mathcal{E} = \Xi_R \oplus \Xi_V \oplus \Xi_T`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{E} = \Xi_R \oplus [\Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Xi_R \oplus (\Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R))]`$
$`= \Xi_R \oplus \Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R) \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Xi_R \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R)]`$
$`= 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Xi_R)`$
$`= \text{SHIFT}(\Xi_R) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Xi_R)`$

This proves that economic systems can be represented as combinations of SHIFT operations on their real domains, embodying the mathematical essence of real economy generating virtual economy and the overall unity of economic systems.

### 5.2 Proof of Unification

**Theorem 3: XOR-SHIFT Economics Completeness**

Any economic change $`\Delta\mathcal{E}`$ can be represented as a combination of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\Delta\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{E}_t = \text{SHIFT}^{k_1}(\mathcal{E}_t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_2}(\mathcal{E}_t) \oplus ... \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_n}(\mathcal{E}_t)`$

This proves the completeness of XOR and SHIFT operations in describing economic evolution, demonstrating that any economic change can be decomposed into an XOR composite of a series of SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 4: XOR-SHIFT Expression of Equilibrium Principle**

The market equilibrium principle can be represented as an XOR-SHIFT process:

$`\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{E}) = \mathcal{E} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{E}) = 0`$

where $`\mathcal{Q}`$ is the disequilibrium measurement function.

This indicates that economic equilibrium is the zero point of XOR-SHIFT operations, where the system no longer undergoes spontaneous change in this state.

### 5.3 Compatibility with Existing Economic Theories

**Theorem 5: Compatibility with Classical Economics**

The law of value in classical economics can be expressed as XOR-SHIFT relationships:

$`V(L^{t+1}) = V(L^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(P^t))`$

where $`V`$ is the value function, $`L^t`$ is labor input, and $`P^t`$ is productivity level.

The XOR-SHIFT form of market clearing:

$`S^{t+1} \oplus D^{t+1} = 0`$, i.e., $`S^{t+1} = D^{t+1}`$

**Theorem 6: Compatibility with Keynesian Economics**

Keynesian effective demand principle can be expressed as SHIFT operations:

$`Y = \text{SHIFT}(C + I + G + NX)`$

where $`Y`$ is national income, $`C`$ is consumption, $`I`$ is investment, $`G`$ is government spending, and $`NX`$ is net exports.

The XOR-SHIFT expression of the multiplier effect:

$`\Delta Y = \Delta I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Delta I) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Delta I) \oplus ...\`$
$`= \Delta I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\frac{1}{1-MPC})`$

where $`MPC`$ is the marginal propensity to consume.

**Theorem 7: Compatibility with Monetary Theory**

Money supply and demand can be represented as XOR-SHIFT relationships:

$`M(P, Y) = |M_S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(M_D)|`$

where $`M`$ is the monetary equilibrium function, $`M_S`$ is money supply, and $`M_D`$ is money demand.

The XOR-SHIFT expression of monetary policy:

$`r^{t+1} = r^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Delta M)`$

where $`r`$ is the interest rate and $`\Delta M`$ is the change in money supply.
