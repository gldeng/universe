## Core Axioms

Cosmic Ontology constructs a complete theoretical system based on the following core axioms:

1. **Absolute Recursive Origin Axiom**: The ultimate nature of the universe is an absolute recursive self-referential structure
   $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$, where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is a super-recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:
   $`\mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

2. **Binary-Unitary Axiom**: The universe simultaneously manifests as duality and unity
   $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$, where $`\Omega_Q`$ is the quantum domain and $`\Omega_C`$ is the classical domain

3. **Information Ontology Axiom**: The fundamental entity of the universe is information
   $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$, where $`I(x)`$ is the information expression function of entity $`x`$
