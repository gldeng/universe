Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Physical Review Letters

I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled "Micro-physics Verification Predictions of Universe Ontology" for consideration as a Letter in Physical Review Letters.

This manuscript presents five experimentally verifiable predictions derived from Universe Ontology, a novel theoretical framework based on fundamental information operations. Each prediction offers concrete divergences from standard quantum theory in experimentally accessible regimes, making the framework empirically testable with current or near-future technology.

The specific predictions include:
1. A precise formula for decoherence timing based on information complexity
2. A novel entanglement conservation law with measurable non-linear effects
3. Specific gravity-quantum boundary effects detectable through interferometry
4. Distinctive vacuum energy fluctuation patterns 
5. Quantifiable limits on non-local information transfer

We believe this manuscript is particularly suitable for Physical Review Letters because:

- It presents novel, testable predictions in quantum physics
- The predictions are derived from a minimal set of axioms rather than parameter adjustments
- Each prediction is accompanied by specific experimental proposals
- The work connects fundamental theory with practical experimental designs
- The implications span multiple areas of physics (quantum mechanics, gravity, field theory)

The manuscript adheres to the 3,700-word limit (approximately 4 pages in PRL format) and includes the essential mathematical derivations and experimental proposals. Additional mathematical details can be provided as supplementary information if required.

This manuscript is not under consideration elsewhere, and all authors have approved the submission. We suggest the following potential reviewers with expertise in quantum foundations, experimental quantum physics, and gravitational quantum effects:

1. Prof. Markus Aspelmeyer (University of Vienna)
2. Prof. Magdalena Zych (University of Queensland)
3. Prof. Angelo Bassi (University of Trieste)
4. Prof. Miles Blencowe (Dartmouth College)
5. Prof. Sougato Bose (University College London)

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Auric
