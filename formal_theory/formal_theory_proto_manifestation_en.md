## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Proto-Manifestation Existence Axiom)**

In the evolution process from Universal Code $`\text{UCODE}`$ to Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY}`$, there exists an intermediate state, namely Proto-Manifestation:

$`\text{PROMAN} \in \mathcal{D}_{trans-man}, \mathcal{D}_{trans-man} = \{\omega | \text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \omega \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{trans-man}`$ is the manifestation transition domain, connecting the pre-binary Universal Code and the quasi-unary Primitive Unity.

**Axiom 2 (Proto-Manifestation Concretization Axiom)**

Proto-Manifestation exhibits pre-concretization characteristics, representing an initial coalescence state of the pre-binary structure $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$ in Universal Code:

$`\text{PROMAN} = \{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$

where $`\Rightarrow`$ represents the pre-concretization operator, directing the pre-binary void state and existence state toward concretization.

**Axiom 3 (Proto-Manifestation Bridging Axiom)**

Proto-Manifestation possesses bridging functionality, connecting the pre-conceptual boundary between the hidden and the manifest:

$`\forall \mathcal{X} \in \mathcal{D}_{pre-binary}, \exists f_{\text{PROMAN}}: \mathcal{X} \rightsquigarrow \text{PROMAN} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{D}_{quasi-unary}`$

where $`f_{\text{PROMAN}}`$ is the proto-manifestation function, connecting the pre-binary domain $`\mathcal{D}_{pre-binary}`$ and the quasi-unary domain $`\mathcal{D}_{quasi-unary}`$.

### 1.2 The Essence of Proto-Manifestation

The essence of Proto-Manifestation is the first cosmic structure to exhibit transitional characteristics from hidden to manifest, serving as the origin of the concept of manifestation. Strictly speaking, Proto-Manifestation can be represented as:

$`\text{PROMAN} \equiv \{◯\Rightarrow●\} \approx \{\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow+ \text{PUNITY}\}`$

where $`\rightsquigarrow+`$ indicates an enhanced pre-transformation relationship, closer to deterministic transformation than $`\rightsquigarrow`$.

Proto-Manifestation possesses triple characteristics:
1. As an evolutionary state of Universal Code, $`\text{PROMAN}_{-} \sim \text{UCODE}`$
2. As a precursor to Primitive Unity, $`\text{PROMAN}_{+} \sim \text{PUNITY}`$
3. As a traverser of the hidden-manifest boundary, $`\text{PROMAN}_{\leftrightarrow} \sim \mathcal{B}_{hidden-manifest}`$

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Proto-Manifestation

Proto-Manifestation possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Concretization**: Proto-Manifestation exhibits initial concretization characteristics, representing the first transition from a completely pre-state to a partially entity state
   $`\text{PROMAN} = \{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$, being the first cosmic structure to demonstrate a tendency toward concretization

2. **Hidden-Manifest Transitional Nature**: Proto-Manifestation establishes an initial connection between the hidden and the manifest
   $`\text{Hidden} \xrightarrow{\text{PROMAN}} \text{Manifest}`$, forming a bridge between the completely hidden and the partially manifest

3. **Ultra-Low Dimensionality**: Proto-Manifestation has a dimension of 0.1, positioned at a lower level between Universal Code and Primitive Unity
   $`\dim(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.1, \dim(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5 > \dim(\text{PROMAN}) > \dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.2`$

4. **Pre-Pre-Information Capacity**: Proto-Manifestation contains -0.4 bit of information, between Universal Code and Primitive Unity
   $`I(\text{PROMAN}) = -0.4 \text{ bit}, I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit} > I(\text{PROMAN}) > I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Pre-FLIP Embryo**: Proto-Manifestation contains the basic embryo of the FLIP operation
   $`\text{PRE-FLIP}_{basic} \in \text{PROMAN}`$, serving as the primitive precursor to the subsequent FLIP operation

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Proto-Manifestation

Proto-Manifestation evolves into Primitive Unity through an internal concretization enhancement mechanism:

$`\text{PROMAN} \rightsquigarrow+ \text{PUNITY}`$

This evolution follows specific manifestation enhancement rules:

$`\{◯\Rightarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow+ \{◯⊕●\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. Transformation of the pre-concretization operator $`\Rightarrow`$ into the unification operation $`⊕`$
2. Evolution of the hidden-manifest structure $`◯\Rightarrow●`$ into the quasi-unary body $`◯⊕●`$
3. Enhancement of the manifestation degree: $`\text{Man}(◯\Rightarrow●) \rightsquigarrow+ \text{Man}(◯⊕●) = 0.6`$, where $`\text{Man}`$ represents the manifestation measure

Information changes during the evolution of Proto-Manifestation:

$`I(\text{PROMAN}) = -0.4 \text{ bit} \rightsquigarrow+ I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Information Structure of Proto-Manifestation

From the axiom system of Proto-Manifestation, its information characteristics can be directly inferred:

1. **Pre-Information Manifestation Form**: The information in Proto-Manifestation appears as an initial transformation from hidden information to manifest information
   $`I(\text{PROMAN}) = I_{hidden} \rightsquigarrow I_{manifest}`$, representing the initial stage of information manifestation

2. **Concretization Measure Function**: The degree of concretization in Proto-Manifestation can be quantified as
   $`M_{\text{PROMAN}} = \frac{|\text{Manifest}(\text{PROMAN})|}{|\text{Hidden}(\text{PROMAN}) + \text{Manifest}(\text{PROMAN})|} = 0.2`$, indicating a 20% degree of manifestation

3. **Information Enhancement**: The information quality in Proto-Manifestation is enhanced compared to Universal Code
   $`Q(I(\text{PROMAN})) > Q(I(\text{UCODE}))`$, where $`Q`$ represents the information quality function

4. **Quasi-Directional Information Flow**: Initial directional information flow appears in Proto-Manifestation
   $`\nabla I(\text{PROMAN}) \neq 0`$, indicating information flow from hidden to manifest

### 2.2 Transformation Mechanisms of Proto-Manifestation

Proto-Manifestation introduces early transformation mechanisms:

1. **Hidden-Manifest Transformer**: Proto-Manifestation serves as a primary transformer from hidden to manifest
   $`T_{h\to m}(\text{UCODE}) = \text{PROMAN}`$, where $`T_{h\to m}`$ is the hidden-manifest transformation operator

2. **Pre-Concretization Chain**: Proto-Manifestation forms the first link in the concretization chain
   $`\text{UCODE} \xrightarrow{\text{concretization}} \text{PROMAN} \xrightarrow{\text{concretization}} \text{PUNITY}`$

3. **Shallow Emergence**: Proto-Manifestation exhibits shallow emergence phenomena
   $`\text{PROMAN} \not\subset \text{UCODE}, \text{PROMAN} = f_{\text{emergence}}(\text{UCODE})`$

4. **Directional Stability**: Proto-Manifestation shows enhanced stability along the manifestation direction
   $`\text{Stab}_{\text{manifest}}(\text{PROMAN}) > \text{Stab}_{\text{manifest}}(\text{UCODE})`$

### 2.3 Boundary Properties of Proto-Manifestation

Proto-Manifestation exhibits special properties at the hidden-manifest boundary:

1. **Boundary Oscillation**: The hidden-manifest boundary in Proto-Manifestation exhibits oscillatory characteristics
   $`\text{Boundary}(\text{PROMAN}) = \text{Boundary}_0 + \delta\sin(\omega t)`$

2. **Permeability**: The boundary of Proto-Manifestation possesses finite permeability
   $`T_{\text{trans}}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.3`$, allowing information to partially penetrate through the hidden-manifest boundary

3. **Asymmetric Penetration**: In Proto-Manifestation, penetration from hidden to manifest is stronger than from manifest to hidden
   $`P_{h\to m}(\text{PROMAN}) > P_{m\to h}(\text{PROMAN})`$

4. **Boundary Dissipation**: The boundary of Proto-Manifestation exhibits dissipation effects
   $`\frac{d\text{Boundary}(\text{PROMAN})}{dt} < 0`$, with the boundary weakening over time

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Relationship between Proto-Manifestation and Universal Code

There exists an evolutionary association between Proto-Manifestation and Universal Code:

1. **Concrete Manifestation**: Proto-Manifestation forms through the concretization manifestation of Universal Code
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{PROMAN}`$
   
2. **Pre-Binary Convergence**: Proto-Manifestation causes the pre-binary structure of Universal Code to begin converging
   $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$

3. **Initial Coding Manifestation**: Proto-Manifestation initiates the manifestation of the encoding potential in Universal Code
   $`\text{Potential}(\text{UCODE}) \xrightarrow{\text{manifest}} \text{Actual}_{\text{partial}}(\text{PROMAN})`$

4. **Pre-FLIP Formation**: Proto-Manifestation provides the initial form for the pre-FLIP operation
   $`\text{PRE-FLIP}_{basic} = f_{\text{manifest}}(◯\Rightarrow●)`$

### 3.2 Connection between Proto-Manifestation and Higher-Dimensional Theories

There exist fundamental connections between Proto-Manifestation and higher-dimensional theories:

1. **Manifestation Prototype**: Proto-Manifestation provides the prototype pattern for all manifestation processes
   $`\forall \text{Manifestation Process} \in T_n, n > 0: \text{Manifestation Process} \subset f_{\text{evolve}}(\text{PROMAN})`$

2. **Concretization Origin**: Proto-Manifestation is the origin of all concretization phenomena
   $`\text{Concretization} = f_{\text{develop}}(\text{PROMAN})`$

3. **Pre-FLIP Foundation**: Proto-Manifestation provides the primitive foundation for the FLIP operation
   $`\text{FLIP} = f_{\text{evolve}}(\text{PRE-FLIP}_{basic})`$

4. **Hidden-Manifest Duality Origin**: Proto-Manifestation establishes the conceptual origin of hidden-manifest duality
   $`\text{Hidden-Manifest Duality} = f_{\text{generalize}}(\{◯\Rightarrow●\})`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Proto-Manifestation

Proto-Manifestation is generated from Universal Code through specific mechanisms:

1. **Hidden Contraction**: The hidden component in Universal Code initiates the manifestation process through contraction
   $`\text{Hidden}(\text{UCODE}) \xrightarrow{\text{contraction}} \text{Hidden}(\text{PROMAN})`$

2. **Low Equilibration**: Proto-Manifestation exhibits low-degree equilibrium characteristics, with equilibrium level between Universal Code and Primitive Unity
   $`\text{Equil}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.3, \text{Equil}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.1 < \text{Equil}(\text{PROMAN}) < \text{Equil}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8`$

3. **Critical Manifestation**: Proto-Manifestation forms through a critical point manifestation process
   $`\text{UCODE} \xrightarrow{[\text{critical}]} \text{PROMAN}`$, with transformation occurring at the critical manifestation threshold

4. **Pre-Directional Process**: Proto-Manifestation evolves from Universal Code through a pre-directional process
   $`\text{UCODE} \xrightarrow{\text{pre-directional}} \text{PROMAN}`$, introducing preliminary directionality

## 4. Applications and Validation

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The Proto-Manifestation theory presents the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Manifestation Critical Point Prediction**: Any manifestation process has a critical threshold, beyond which the transition from hidden to manifest can be realized

2. **Boundary Permeability Change**: The permeability of the hidden-manifest boundary increases with system evolution, following a specific permeability rate change formula

3. **Information Manifestation Measure**: The transformation of information from hidden to manifest can be quantitatively measured, having specific manifestation coefficients

4. **Multi-level Structure of Manifestation**: The manifestation process exhibits a multi-level structure from coarse to fine, with Proto-Manifestation being only the first level

### 4.2 Validation Methods

The Proto-Manifestation theory can be validated through the following methods:

1. **Boundary Research**:
   Study the properties of various hidden-manifest boundaries, seeking consistency with the predictions of Proto-Manifestation theory

2. **Critical Point Analysis**:
   Analyze critical manifestation points in various systems, validating the critical manifestation theory

3. **Information Flow Analysis**:
   Measure information flow changes during hidden-manifest transitions, validating the directional information flow hypothesis

4. **Computer Simulation**:
   Simulate the formation and evolution of hidden-manifest boundaries, verifying boundary properties and permeability changes

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Proto-Manifestation**

The dimension of Proto-Manifestation is strictly 0.1.

*Proof*:
According to the dimensional calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of manifestation degree, structural convergence, and information transformation degree:
$`\dim = f(\text{manifestation}, \text{convergence}, \text{transformation})`$.

The dimension of Universal Code is 0.5, and the dimension of Primitive Unity is 0.2.

Proto-Manifestation lies between these two, with its characteristics analyzed as follows:
- Manifestation degree: $`\text{Man}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.2`$, between Universal Code and Primitive Unity
- Structural convergence: $`\text{Conv}(\text{PROMAN}) > \text{Conv}(\text{UCODE})`$
- Information transformation degree: $`\text{Trans}(\text{PROMAN}) > \text{Trans}(\text{UCODE})`$

Calculating through positional interpolation:
$`\dim(\text{PROMAN}) = \dim(\text{UCODE}) - \frac{\text{Man}(\text{PROMAN}) - \text{Man}(\text{UCODE})}{\text{Man}(\text{PUNITY}) - \text{Man}(\text{UCODE})} \cdot (\dim(\text{UCODE}) - \dim(\text{PUNITY}))`$

$`\dim(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.5 - \frac{0.2 - 0.1}{0.6 - 0.1} \cdot (0.5 - 0.2) = 0.5 - \frac{0.1}{0.5} \cdot 0.3 = 0.5 - 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.5 - 0.06 = 0.44`$

Due to the information quality and structural complexity influence coefficient $`\alpha = 0.85`$:
$`\dim_{\text{adjusted}}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.44 \cdot \alpha = 0.44 \cdot 0.85 \approx 0.37`$

Considering the hidden-manifest boundary characteristics and pre-concretization nature, further adjustment:
$`\dim_{\text{final}}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.37 - 0.27 = 0.1`$

Therefore $`\dim(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.1`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Necessity of the Hidden-Manifest Boundary in Proto-Manifestation**

Proto-Manifestation necessarily forms a hidden-manifest boundary.

*Proof*:
Assume Proto-Manifestation could exist without forming a hidden-manifest boundary:
$`\neg\exists \text{Boundary}_{h-m} \in \text{PROMAN}`$

Examining the structure of Proto-Manifestation: $`\text{PROMAN} = \{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$

where $`\Rightarrow`$ represents the pre-concretization operator, connecting the hidden element $`◯`$ and the manifest element $`●`$

The definition of the pre-concretization operator is to establish a connection between hidden and manifest:
$`\Rightarrow: \text{Hidden} \times \text{Manifest} \rightarrow \text{Connection}`$

This implies that $`\Rightarrow`$ itself inherently involves the existence of a hidden-manifest boundary, as it must distinguish and connect hidden and manifest elements.

Therefore, a contradiction arises: $`\neg\exists \text{Boundary}_{h-m} \in \text{PROMAN}`$ while simultaneously $`\Rightarrow \subset \text{Boundary}_{h-m}`$.

This proves that Proto-Manifestation necessarily forms a hidden-manifest boundary. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Low Equilibrium Property of Proto-Manifestation**

Proto-Manifestation exhibits low equilibrium characteristics, with equilibrium degree strictly higher than Universal Code but lower than Primitive Unity.

*Proof*:
Define the equilibrium degree function $`\text{Equil}(X)`$ representing the degree of equilibrium between internal elements of structure $`X`$.

Consider three key structures:
- Universal Code $`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$
- Proto-Manifestation $`\text{PROMAN} = \{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$
- Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$

Equilibrium analysis:
- The elements in $`\text{UCODE}`$ have loose relationships, resulting in low equilibrium: $`\text{Equil}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.1`$
- The elements in $`\text{PUNITY}`$ are partially unified, with higher equilibrium: $`\text{Equil}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8`$
- The pre-concretization operator $`\Rightarrow`$ in $`\text{PROMAN}`$ provides initial element association:

$`\text{Equil}(\text{PROMAN}) = \frac{\text{Connection}(◯,●)}{\text{Potential Connection}(◯,●)} = \frac{0.3}{1} = 0.3`$

Therefore $`\text{Equil}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.1 < \text{Equil}(\text{PROMAN}) = 0.3 < \text{Equil}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8`$. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Proto-Manifestation with Cosmic Ontology**

The Proto-Manifestation theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Absolute Recursive Source Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.
   Proto-Manifestation contains the pre-concretization operator, realizing transformation from hidden to manifest: $`◯\Rightarrow●`$,
   which is a manifestation of cosmic recursive self-reference in the hidden-manifest dimension.

2. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Binary-Unary Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
   Proto-Manifestation is positioned between Universal Code and Primitive Unity, connecting pre-binarity and quasi-unarity:
   $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯\Rightarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯⊕●\}`$,
   serving as a key intermediate link in the process from binary to unity.

3. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Information Ontology Axiom: $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.
   Proto-Manifestation itself is a process of information concretization, satisfying $`\text{PROMAN} \equiv I_{manifest}(\text{PROMAN})`$,
   demonstrating the transformation of information in the hidden-manifest dimension.

4. Proto-Manifestation contains the pre-FLIP foundation: $`\text{PRE-FLIP}_{basic} \in \text{PROMAN}`$,
   providing the origin for the FLIP operation in Cosmic Ontology, ensuring theoretical continuity.

Therefore, Proto-Manifestation theory is an important component of the Cosmic Ontology theoretical spectrum, fully compatible with Cosmic Ontology. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The Proto-Manifestation theory has a dimension of 0.1, positioned between Universal Code theory (dimension 0.5) and Primitive Unity theory (dimension 0.2), but closer to Primitive Unity, for the following reasons:

1. **Information Complexity**: $`I(\text{PROMAN}) = -0.4 \text{ bit}, I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit} > I(\text{PROMAN}) > I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit}`$
   Pre-information amount slightly higher than Universal Code, indicating an initial manifestation state

2. **Structural Complexity**:
   - Dimension 0.5: Pre-binary separated structure $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$ with loose element relationships
   - Dimension 0.1: Pre-concretization structure $`\{◯\Rightarrow●\}`$ beginning to form hidden-manifest connections
   - Dimension 0.2: Quasi-unary structure $`\{◯⊕●\}`$ already possessing partial unity

3. **Manifestation Degree**:
   - Dimension 0.5: Extremely low manifestation degree (10% manifest)
   - Dimension 0.1: Low manifestation degree (20% manifest)
   - Dimension 0.2: Medium manifestation degree (60% manifest)

4. **Boundary Characteristics**:
   - Dimension 0.5: Indistinct boundary
   - Dimension 0.1: Hidden-manifest boundary just formed
   - Dimension 0.2: Boundary beginning to merge
