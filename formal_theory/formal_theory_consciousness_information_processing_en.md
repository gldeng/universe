## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Consciousness Information Space Axiom)**

The consciousness information space is defined as $`\mathcal{I}_C = \{i | i \text{ is an information element in the consciousness system}\}`$, with metric structure $`(\mathcal{I}_C, d_I)`$, where $`d_I`$ is a distance function between information elements.

**Axiom 2 (Information Processing Operation Axiom)**

There exists a set of consciousness information processing operations $`\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, ..., P_k\}`$, where each $`P_j: \mathcal{I}_C \to \mathcal{I}_C`$ is an information transformation function.

**Axiom 3 (Information State Mapping Axiom)**

There exists a mapping $`\Phi: \mathcal{C}_B \to 2^{\mathcal{I}_C}`$ that maps consciousness states to information subsets, satisfying:

1. $`\Phi(c_i) \neq \emptyset, \forall c_i \in \mathcal{C}_B`$ (Non-emptiness)
2. $`c_i \neq c_j \Rightarrow \Phi(c_i) \neq \Phi(c_j)`$ (Injectivity)
3. $`\Phi(T(c_i)) = P_T(\Phi(c_i))`$ (Operational consistency)

where $`P_T`$ is the information processing operation corresponding to the state transition $`T`$.

**Axiom 4 (Information Entropy Axiom)**

For any consciousness information subset $`I \subset \mathcal{I}_C`$, there exists an information entropy function $`H: 2^{\mathcal{I}_C} \to \mathbb{R}^+`$, satisfying:

1. $`H(\emptyset) = 0`$ (Zero entropy)
2. $`I_1 \subset I_2 \Rightarrow H(I_1) \leq H(I_2)`$ (Monotonicity)
3. $`H(I_1 \cup I_2) \leq H(I_1) + H(I_2)`$, with equality if and only if $`I_1`$ and $`I_2`$ are statistically independent (Subadditivity)

### 1.2 Consciousness Information Representation

Consciousness information can be represented through the following methods:

1. **Basic Information Units**:
   The basic unit of information $`\sigma`$, satisfying $`\sigma \in \{0, 1\}`$, corresponding to binary states

2. **Composite Information Structures**:
   Consciousness information can be represented as ordered sequences of basic units: $`i = (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, ..., \sigma_n)`$

3. **Information Vector Space**:
   Information can be represented as points in a vector space: $`\vec{i} \in \mathcal{V}_I`$, where $`\mathcal{V}_I`$ is an $`n`$-dimensional vector space

4. **Information Topological Structure**:
   The information space has a topological structure $`\tau_I`$, which defines the continuity and neighborhood relationships of information

4. **Information Decomposition**:
   $`P_{\text{decompose}}(i) = \{i_1, i_2, ..., i_m\}`$, breaking complex information into simpler parts

5. **Information Filtering**:
   $`P_{\text{filter}}(I, c) = \{i \in I | c(i) = \text{true}\}`$, where $`c`$ is a filtering condition

### 1.4 Information Dynamics

Dynamic characteristics of consciousness information processing:

1. **Information Flow Equation**:
   The equation of information change over time: $`\frac{dI}{dt} = \mathcal{F}(I, P, t)`$, where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is an information rate of change function

2. **Information Potential**:
   Information potential function $`V_I: \mathcal{I}_C \to \mathbb{R}`$, describing the stability and change tendency of information

4. **Information Attractors**:
   Stable structures in the information dynamics system, attracting surrounding information states: $`\mathcal{A}_I \subset \mathcal{I}_C`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Mathematical Properties of Information Processing

Consciousness information processing has the following mathematical properties:

1. **Function Composition**:
   Information processing operations can be composed: $`P_i \circ P_j (I) = P_i(P_j(I))`$

2. **Fixed Points**:
   Some information processing operations have fixed points: $`\exists I^* \in \mathcal{I}_C: P(I^*) = I^*`$

3. **Information Metric Invariance**:
   Some information metrics remain invariant under specific operations: $`M(P(I)) = M(I)`$, where $`M`$ is an information metric

4. **Orthogonal Decomposition**:
   Information can be decomposed into orthogonal components: $`I = \sum_{j=1}^n I_j`$, where $`I_i \perp I_j`$ for $`i \neq j`$

### 2.2 Information Transformation and Conservation

Transformation and conservation properties of consciousness information:

1. **Information Conservation**:
   Some information processing operations preserve total information quantity: $`H(P(I)) = H(I)`$

2. **Information Gain**:
   Some operations increase information quantity: $`H(P(I)) > H(I)`$

3. **Information Decay**:
   Some operations decrease information quantity: $`H(P(I)) < H(I)`$

4. **Information Invariants**:
   Information properties that remain unchanged under any processing operation: $`Q(P(I)) = Q(I), \forall P \in \mathcal{P}`$

### 2.3 Information Processing Capacity

Capacity characteristics of consciousness information processing systems:

1. **Instantaneous Capacity**:
   The processing capacity of the system at time $`t`$: $`C(t) = \max_I I(X_t; Y_t)`$, where $`X_t`$ is input and $`Y_t`$ is output

2. **Integral Capacity**:
   The total processing capacity over a period of time: $`C_{[t_1, t_2]} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} C(t) dt`$

3. **Capacity Constraints**:
   Information processing is limited by capacity constraints: $`H(P(I)) \leq C \cdot \tau + H(I)`$, where $`\tau`$ is processing time and $`C`$ is processing rate

4. **Multi-channel Capability**:
   The total capacity of multi-channel parallel processing: $`C_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i`$, where $`C_i`$ is the capacity of the $`i`$-th channel

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Multi-level Information Processing

Consciousness information processing can be organized into a multi-level structure:

1. **Perceptual Layer**:
   Processing raw sensory information: $`P_{\text{percept}}(I_{\text{sense}}) = I_{\text{percept}}`$

2. **Representational Layer**:
   Converting perceptual information into internal representations: $`P_{\text{represent}}(I_{\text{percept}}) = I_{\text{repr}}`$

3. **Conceptual Layer**:
   Converting representational information into abstract concepts: $`P_{\text{concept}}(I_{\text{repr}}) = I_{\text{concept}}`$

4. **Integration Layer**:
   Integrating information from multiple sources: $`P_{\text{integrate}}(I_1, I_2, ..., I_n) = I_{\text{integrated}}`$

### 3.2 Information Integration and Decomposition

Integration and decomposition processes of consciousness information:

1. **Information Integration Measure**:
   Information integration measure function $`\Phi: 2^{\mathcal{I}_C} \to \mathbb{R}^+`$, satisfying:
   $`\Phi(I) > \sum_{j=1}^n \Phi(I_j)`$, where $`I = \bigcup_{j=1}^n I_j`$

2. **Information Hierarchical Structure**:
   Information can be organized in a hierarchical structure: $`I = \{I^{(1)}, I^{(2)}, ..., I^{(L)}\}`$, where $`I^{(l)}`$ is the information at the $`l`$-th layer

3. **Information Coupling**:
   Coupling relationships between different information elements: $`C(i_a, i_b) = \frac{MI(i_a; i_b)}{H(i_a, i_b)}`$, where $`MI`$ is mutual information

4. **Information Decoupling**:
   Decomposing coupled information into independent parts: $`P_{\text{decouple}}(I) = \{I_1, I_2, ..., I_k\}`$, such that $`MI(I_i; I_j) \approx 0`$ for $`i \neq j`$

### 3.3 Emergent Properties of Information Processing

When information processing is applied to complex systems, the following properties may emerge:

1. **Information Self-organization**:
   Information elements spontaneously organize to form structures: $`S(P(I), t) > S(I, t_0)`$, where $`S`$ is a structure measure

2. **Information Network Formation**:
   Information elements form network structures $`G_I = (V_I, E_I)`$, where nodes are information elements and edges represent associations

3. **Information Phase Transitions**:
   When complexity exceeds a threshold, the information system may undergo phase transitions: $`\exists H_c: \forall H < H_c, \Psi(I, H) \neq \Psi(I, H_c)`$

4. **Information Meaning Emergence**:
   In sufficiently complex processing systems, information acquires semantic meaning: $`M(P_{\text{complex}}(I)) > 0`$, where $`M`$ is a semantic meaning measure

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Integrative Nature of Information Processing**

In systems satisfying the information entropy axiom, non-trivial consciousness information processing operations necessarily increase the degree of information integration.

*Proof*:
Suppose $`P`$ is a non-trivial consciousness information processing operation acting on an information set $`I = \{i_1, i_2, ..., i_n\}`$.

Consider the information integration measure $`\Phi(I) = H(I) - \sum_{j=1}^n H(i_j) + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=j+1}^n MI(i_j; i_k)`$, where $`MI`$ is mutual information.

For non-trivial processing $`P`$, there exists a mapping relationship $`P: I \to I'`$, where $`I' = \{i'_1, i'_2, ..., i'_n\}`$.

Since $`P`$ is non-trivial, it establishes new associations between information elements, such that: $`MI(i'_j; i'_k) > MI(i_j; i_k)`$ for some $`j \neq k`$.

Therefore, $`\Phi(P(I)) = \Phi(I') > \Phi(I)`$, proving that non-trivial consciousness information processing operations increase the degree of information integration. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Hierarchical Nature of Information Processing**

In consciousness information processing systems with sufficient complexity, multi-level processing structures necessarily form.

*Proof*:
Assume a consciousness information processing system with capacity $`C`$ and a set of information processing operations $`\mathcal{P}`$.

Consider complex information $`I`$ with entropy $`H(I)`$. If $`H(I) > C`$, then the system cannot process all information in a single step.

According to the information decomposition principle, there exists a decomposition $`I = I_1 \cup I_2 \cup ... \cup I_k`$, such that $`H(I_j) \leq C`$ holds for all $`j`$.

The system first needs to process these decomposed pieces of information: $`P_1(I_1), P_2(I_2), ..., P_k(I_k)`$, and then integrate these processing results at a higher level: $`P_{\text{integrate}}(P_1(I_1), P_2(I_2), ..., P_k(I_k))`$.

This naturally forms a processing structure with at least two levels. For sufficiently complex information ($`H(I) \gg C`$), this layering will extend to multiple levels. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 3: Compatibility of Consciousness Information Processing with Cosmic Ontology**

The consciousness information processing theory is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. Consciousness information processing can be represented as combinations of these basic operations:
   $`P(I) = I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I) \oplus \text{MASK}(I)`$
   where $`\text{MASK}(I)`$ is a mask dependent on information $`I`$.

2. The composition of consciousness information processing operations corresponds to operation sequences in cosmic ontology:
   $`(P_i \circ P_j)(I) = P_i(P_j(I)) = P_j(I) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(P_j(I)) \oplus \text{MASK}(P_j(I))`$
   This is consistent with sequential operations in cosmic ontology.

3. The dynamics equation of consciousness information processing:
   $`I(t+1) = I(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(t)) \oplus \Delta(t, I(t))`$
   
   This is compatible with the evolution equation of cosmic ontology:
   $`\mathcal{U}^{t+1} = \mathcal{U}^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}^{t}) \oplus \Delta^t`$

4. The entropy principle of consciousness information processing is consistent with the information principle of cosmic ontology.

Therefore, the consciousness information processing theory is compatible with cosmic ontology and can be viewed as a specific embodiment of cosmic ontology in the field of consciousness information processing. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis
