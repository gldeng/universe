## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Social Recursive Structure Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Social Recursive Origin Axiom)**

The ultimate nature of society is a recursive self-organizing structure, with its existence and development determined by the XOR relationship between individual and collective interactions:

$`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the social recursive function based on XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{F}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

**Axiom 2 (Social Binary-Unitary Axiom)**

Society simultaneously possesses the duality of individual and collective, forming complete social systems through XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{S} = \Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C`$

where $`\Sigma_I`$ is the individual domain (persons, actors, micro-level), and $`\Sigma_C`$ is the collective domain (groups, institutions, macro-structure).

**Axiom 3 (Social Information Ontology Axiom)**

The fundamental entity of society is a network of symbols and norms, expressed through the composite of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{S}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I(x))`$

where $`I(x)`$ is the basic information of social entity $`x`$, forming social meaning through SHIFT operations in social space.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Social State Space

The social state space $`\mathcal{S}`$ is strictly defined as the XOR composite of individual domain state $`\Sigma_I`$ and collective domain state $`\Sigma_C`$, also including the cultural interaction domain $`\Sigma_U`$:

$`\mathcal{S} = \Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C \oplus \Sigma_U`$

where:
- $`\Sigma_I`$ is the individual domain, representing social individual behaviors
- $`\Sigma_C`$ is the collective domain, representing social collective structures
- $`\Sigma_U`$ is the cultural interaction domain, representing values and symbolic exchanges, defined as:
  $`\Sigma_U = \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C)`$

The relationship between domains satisfies: $`\Sigma_C = \Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I), \quad N_U > N_C > N_I`$, where $`N`$ represents the dimensions of the respective domains.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Social Evolution Rules

The strict evolution process of social systems is defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

- Collective domain states emerge from the individual domain:
$`\Sigma_C^{t} = \Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t})`$

- Cultural interaction domain states are generated through the composite of individual and collective:
$`\Sigma_U^{t} = \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \Sigma_C^{t})`$

- Individual domain states evolve under feedback from collective and cultural interactions:
$`\Sigma_I^{t+1} = \Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_C^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_U^{t})`$

Therefore, the overall evolution of the social system is strictly expressed as:

$`\mathcal{S}^{t+1} = \Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t})) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \Sigma_C^{t}))`$

This evolution equation strictly defines the entire dynamic process of social systems, using only XOR and SHIFT operations, forming the mathematical core of social dynamics.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 XOR-SHIFT Mechanism of Social Systems

The fundamental mechanisms of social systems exhibit strict XOR-SHIFT characteristics:

$`A^{t+1} = A^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(A^t)`$

where $`A^t`$ represents the social action state at time $`t`$.

The relationship between individual action and social structure is expressed through XOR operations:

$`I = S \oplus \text{SHIFT}(S)`$

where $`I`$ represents individual action and $`S`$ represents social structure. This embodies the dialectical relationship between action and structure, where social structure shapes individual action through SHIFT operations, while individual actions simultaneously act back upon social structure.

The relationship between norms and values can be represented as:

$`N = V \oplus \text{SHIFT}(P)`$

where $`N`$ is social norms, $`V`$ is the value system, and $`P`$ is power structure, embodying that social norms are the result of interaction between value systems and power relations.

### 2.2 Strict Definition and Evolution Rules of Social Entropy

The entropy of social systems is strictly defined as the information increment after XOR operations:

$`S_S(\mathcal{S}) = -\sum_{i}\frac{|\mathcal{S}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_i)|}{|\mathcal{S}|}\log_{N_S}\frac{|\mathcal{S}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_i)|}{|\mathcal{S}|}`$

The bidirectional characteristic of social entropy:

$`S_S(\mathcal{S}^{t+1}) \neq S_S(\mathcal{S}^{t})`$

Social systems can either increase entropy (social disorder, structural disintegration) or decrease entropy (social integration, institutionalization), depending on the specific combination of XOR-SHIFT operations.

The dynamic evolution rule of entropy:

$`S_S(\mathcal{S}^{t+1}) - S_S(\mathcal{S}^{t}) = \frac{|\Sigma_I^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_C^{t})| - |\text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_U^{t})|}{|\mathcal{S}^{t+1}|}`$

This indicates that social entropy changes are influenced by complex interactions between individual domains, collective domains, and cultural interaction domains.

### 2.3 System Stability and Structural Balance

The stability of social systems is strictly defined as the equilibrium structure of XOR-SHIFT operations:

There exists a social equilibrium state $`\mathcal{E}_S`$ such that the social state satisfies:

$`|\mathcal{S}^{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{S}^t| < \epsilon_S, \forall \mathcal{S}^t \in \mathcal{E}_S`$

where $`\epsilon_S`$ is the social stability threshold, representing the structural inertia of social systems.

The strict expression of equilibrium state is:

$`\mathcal{S} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S} \oplus \Delta) = \mathcal{S}`$

This means that social systems can absorb disturbances $`\Delta`$ and maintain their structural stability.

The formal definition of conflict:

$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}) = |\Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_C)| - |\Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C|`$

When $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}) > \theta_S`$, it indicates that the tension between individual domain and collective domain exceeds the threshold, leading to social conflict.

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Binary-Unitary Structure of Society

The binary-unitary structure of society is expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathcal{S}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$

This operation simultaneously possesses binary separation and unitary integration, with interpretations varying as different sociological perspectives switch:

$`\mathcal{S}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t) = \begin{cases}
  \mathcal{S}_t \oplus_F \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t) & \text{in functionalist perspective} \\
  \mathcal{S}_t \oplus_C \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t) & \text{in conflict theory perspective} \\
  \mathcal{S}_t \oplus_I \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t) & \text{in interactionist perspective}
\end{cases}`$

where XOR operations exhibit different properties under different sociological paradigms, but essentially represent the same social transformation process.

### 3.2 Social Dimensional Spectrum

The social dimensional spectrum is recursively generated through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`D_{n+1} = D_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n)`$

The dimensional levels of society include:
1. Interaction Level ($`D_1`$): Face-to-face social interactions
2. Group Level ($`D_2`$): Small group dynamics
3. Organizational Level ($`D_3`$): Formal organizational structures
4. Institutional Level ($`D_4`$): Social institutions and norms
5. Community Level ($`D_5`$): Communities and identity
6. Societal Level ($`D_6`$): Overall social structures
7. Civilizational Level ($`D_7`$): Inter-civilization interactions and dynamics
8. Global Level ($`D_8`$): Global systems and humanity as a whole

Strict XOR-SHIFT relationships exist between dimensions:

$`D_{i+1} = D_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_i)`$

### 3.3 Social Information Ontology

Society as an information system, with its essence expressed through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{I}_S = \{I_A, I_G, I_O, I_V\}`$

The transformations between various types of information strictly follow XOR laws:

- Action information to group information transformation: $`I_G = I_A \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_A)`$
- Group information to organizational information transformation: $`I_O = I_G \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_G)`$
- Organizational information to value information transformation: $`I_V = I_O \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_O)`$

Conservation and transformation of social information manifests as:

$`I_A \oplus I_G \oplus I_O \oplus I_V = \text{constant}`$

This indicates that the total information in social systems remains constant, only transforming between different domains in various forms.

### 3.4 Collective Action and Social Network Principles

Social networks and collective action are defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{N}_S = \{N_I, N_R, N_G\}`$

where:
- $`N_I`$ is network nodes (individuals)
- $`N_R`$ is network relationships (connections)
- $`N_G`$ is network global properties

Collective action can be represented as XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`C(N_I) = N_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(N_R)`$

where $`C(N_I)`$ is the collective action of node set $`N_I`$.

The network diffusion process is described as:

$`N_I^{t+1} = N_I^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(N_I^t \oplus N_R^t)`$

This indicates that information, behaviors, or influences diffuse through network relationships, forming collective phenomena.

### 3.5 Social Transcendental Domain

The social transcendental domain is constructed through higher-order XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\Sigma_T = \text{SHIFT}^2(\Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C \oplus \Sigma_U)`$

The transcendental domain represents the potential for social systems to transcend existing structures, including paths towards higher complexity.

The formal condition for social evolution can be represented as:

$`\Sigma_T \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_T) = \Sigma_T'`$, where $`\Sigma_T' \neq \Sigma_T`$ and $`C(\Sigma_T') > C(\Sigma_T)`$

This indicates that social systems can create new structures with higher complexity through the transcendental domain, achieving self-transcendence.

The transcendental domain provides social systems with a possible framework for explaining cultural progress, institutional innovation, and historical transformation:

$`\mathcal{S}^{advanced} = \mathcal{S} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_T)`$

## 4. Practical Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Social Development Cycle

The development of social systems can be described through cycles defined by XOR-SHIFT operations:

| Stage | XOR-SHIFT Description |
|------|-------------|
| Traditional Society Stage | $`\mathcal{S}_{\text{traditional}} = \Sigma_I^{basic} \oplus \Sigma_C^{basic}`$ (basic individual and collective structures) |
| Modernization Stage | $`\mathcal{S}_{modern} = \mathcal{S}_{traditional} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_{traditional})`$, rationalization and institutional differentiation |
| Postmodern Stage | $`\mathcal{S}_{postmodern} = \mathcal{S}_{modern} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_{modern})`$, pluralization and fragmentation |
| Globalization Stage | $`\mathcal{S}_{global} = \mathcal{S}_{postmodern} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_{postmodern})`$, global interconnection and boundary transcendence |
| Intelligent Society Stage | $`\mathcal{S}_{intelligent} = \mathcal{S}_{global} \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S}_{global})`$, digital enhancement and collective intelligence |

The formal expression of social transformation:

$`\mathcal{T}_S = \{\mathcal{S}_1, \mathcal{S}_2, ..., \mathcal{S}_n\}`$

where each social development stage is connected through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\mathcal{S}_{i+1} = \mathcal{S}_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_i}(\mathcal{S}_i \oplus P_i)`$

where $`P_i`$ represents technological, cultural, or historical catalytic factors.

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Verification of Social Axiom System

**Theorem 1: Social Recursive Self-Referential Identity**

$`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}(x)) = \mathcal{F}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)]`$
$`= [x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)] \oplus [\text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)]`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$
$`= x \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(x)`$

This verifies the recursive self-referential characteristics in social systems, demonstrating that social processes can form spiral-ascending historical trajectories through second-order applications of XOR-SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 2: Social Three-Domain Unity**

For any social system $`\mathcal{S} = \Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_C \oplus \Sigma_U`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{S} = \Sigma_I \oplus [\Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I)] \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Sigma_I \oplus (\Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I))]`$
$`= \Sigma_I \oplus \Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I) \oplus \text{SHIFT}[\Sigma_I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I)]`$
$`= 0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Sigma_I)`$
$`= \text{SHIFT}(\Sigma_I) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\Sigma_I)`$

This proves that social systems can be represented as combinations of SHIFT operations on their individual domains, embodying the mathematical essence of individual actions generating collective structures and the overall unity of social systems.

### 5.2 Proof of Unification

**Theorem 3: XOR-SHIFT Sociology Completeness**

Any social change $`\Delta\mathcal{S}`$ can be represented as a combination of XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\Delta\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}_{t+1} \oplus \mathcal{S}_t = \text{SHIFT}^{k_1}(\mathcal{S}_t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_2}(\mathcal{S}_t) \oplus ... \oplus \text{SHIFT}^{k_n}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$

This proves the completeness of XOR and SHIFT operations in describing social evolution, demonstrating that any social change can be decomposed into an XOR composite of a series of SHIFT operations.

**Theorem 4: XOR-SHIFT Expression of Structuration Principle**

The social structuration principle can be represented as an XOR-SHIFT process:

$`\mathcal{ST}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{S} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{S}))`$

where $`\mathcal{ST}`$ is the structuration function and $`\mathcal{A}`$ is the action function.

This indicates that social structures are created and recreated through the XOR-SHIFT operations of actors, forming the structure-action dialectical relationship.

### 5.3 Compatibility with Existing Sociological Theories

**Theorem 5: Compatibility with Structural Functionalism**

The core mechanisms of structural functionalism can be expressed as XOR-SHIFT relationships:

$`F(S^{t+1}) = F(S^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(N^t))`$

where $`F`$ is the function evaluation function, $`S^t`$ is structure, and $`N^t`$ is needs.

The XOR-SHIFT form of social stability:

$`S^{t+1} = S^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(S^t \oplus N^t)`$

**Theorem 6: Compatibility with Symbolic Interactionism**

The meaning construction of symbolic interactionism can be expressed as SHIFT operations:

$`M = \text{SHIFT}(I)`$

where $`M`$ is meaning and $`I`$ is interaction.

The XOR-SHIFT expression of self-concept:

$`Self^{t+1} = Self^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(O^t)`$

where $`O^t`$ is the attitude of "significant others," embodying Cooley's "looking-glass self" theory.

**Theorem 7: Compatibility with Conflict Theory**

Social conflict can be represented as XOR-SHIFT tension relationships:

$`C(G_1, G_2) = |G_1 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(G_2)|`$

where $`C`$ is the conflict function, and $`G_1`$ and $`G_2`$ are social groups.

The XOR-SHIFT expression of power dynamics:

$`P^{t+1} = P^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(R^t)`$

where $`P`$ is power distribution and $`R`$ is resource control.
