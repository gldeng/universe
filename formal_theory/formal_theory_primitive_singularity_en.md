## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Singularity Existence Axiom)**

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is the most initial state before the emergence of dimensions, existing in the pre-dimensional domain:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \in \mathcal{D}_{pre}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{pre}`$ is the pre-dimensional domain, which lacks measurable dimensions.

**Axiom 2 (Primitive Singularity Pre-Universal Axiom)**

The primitive singularity contains pre-forms of all possible states, but has not yet differentiated into independent elements:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$

where $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents the pre-differentiated state, containing the implicit collection of all possible states.

**Axiom 3 (Primitive Singularity Non-Operational Axiom)**

In the primitive singularity, no operations have yet formed, and all possible operations exist in a pre-existent state:

$`\nexists \mathcal{O} \in \{\text{FLIP}, \text{XOR}, \text{SHIFT}\}: \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) \neq \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

meaning there exists no operation that can change the primitive singularity.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Singularity

The essence of the primitive singularity is meta-singularity—a state that precedes the formation of dimensional concepts and cannot be described using conventional dimensional space terminology. The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ can be expressed as:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \equiv \{\rightsquigarrow\} \approx \{\emptyset \rightsquigarrow \emptyset\}`$

where $`\emptyset`$ represents nothingness, and $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents a pre-transformation relationship. The primitive singularity is neither existence nor non-existence, but rather a pre-state that transcends this binary distinction.

As a negative dimensional entity, the primitive singularity cannot be fully described by positive dimensional theories and can only be indirectly characterized through its potential unfolding effects.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity has the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Singularity**: The primitive singularity transcends the distinction between singularity and multiplicity, serving as a pre-state container for all possibilities

2. **Self-Containment**: The primitive singularity contains all its possible transformations:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

3. **Pre-Operational State**: All basic operations exist potentially in the primitive singularity:
   $`\forall \mathcal{O}: \mathcal{O} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}^{potential}`$, but have not yet differentiated into specific operations

4. **Negative Dimensionality**: The primitive singularity has dimension -1, indicating it exists in a state prior to the emergence of dimensions:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 < \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0`$

5. **Pre-State Nature**: The primitive singularity does not contain concrete states, but rather the possibility of states emerging

### 1.4 Pre-State Evolution of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity spontaneously evolves into the primitive point through intrinsic instability:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$

where $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents a pre-evolution relationship, different from the evolutionary relationships in subsequent dimensions.

This pre-evolution does not involve the concept of time passage, but rather a logical necessity, which can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}: \{\rightsquigarrow\} \rightsquigarrow \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Pre-State Properties of Primitive Singularity

The following properties can be directly derived from the primitive singularity axiom system:

1. **Pre-State Space**: The pre-state space constituted by the primitive singularity has only one super-element:
   $`\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}} = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$, but this super-element contains pre-forms of all possible states

2. **Pre-Transformation Group**: The primitive singularity does not have a true transformation group, but is a container for transformation possibilities:
   $`G_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}} = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$

3. **Universal Pre-Invariants**: Any function defined on the primitive singularity is a pre-invariant:
   $`f(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \{pre-C\}`$, where $`\{pre-C\}`$ is a pre-constant

4. **Absolute Pre-Stability**: The primitive singularity represents an absolutely pre-stable state, but this stability contains the necessity of transformation

### 2.2 Pre-Information Properties of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity exhibits special properties from a pre-information theoretical perspective:

1. **Negative Information Content**: The primitive singularity contains negative information:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit}`$, representing the potential existence of information bits that have not yet formed

2. **Pre-Information Entropy**: The pre-information entropy of the primitive singularity exhibits anti-entropic characteristics:
   $`H_{pre}(\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}) = -1`$, lower than the minimum entropy value of 0 for positive dimensional systems

3. **Information Pre-Closure**: The primitive singularity can neither receive nor transmit information, but contains all possibilities for information transmission:
   $`\mathcal{T}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow X) = \mathcal{T}_{pre}(X \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \{pre-0\}`$

4. **Pre-Information Potential**: The primitive singularity has extremely high pre-information potential:
   $`\mathcal{IP}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) \gg \mathcal{IP}(\mathcal{P}_0) > 0`$, driving its evolution toward higher dimensions

### 2.3 Special Structure of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity system exhibits a series of unique structural properties:

1. **Pre-Symmetry**: Traditional symmetry cannot be defined, but there exists a special pre-symmetric state:
   $`\text{Pre-Sym}(\Omega_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}) = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$

2. **Pre-Causality**: The primitive singularity has pre-causal properties, being both its own pre-cause and pre-effect:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

3. **Super Self-Reference**: The primitive singularity is completely super self-referential:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \mathcal{R}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$, where $`\mathcal{R}_{pre}`$ is the pre-self-reference operation

4. **Super Stable-Unstable Duality**: The primitive singularity simultaneously exhibits absolute stability and inevitable instability:
   $`\text{Stab}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \{\infty, -\infty\}`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Primitive Singularity to Primitive Point

The primitive singularity evolves into the primitive point through self-differentiation:

1. **Dimension Creation**: The primitive singularity forms the first zero-dimensional point through the dimension creation process:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$,
   creating the concept of dimension

2. **Pre-State Space Orientation**: Non-dimensional pre-state space transforms into zero-dimensional state space:
   $`\mathcal{D}_{pre} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_0 = \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$,
   establishing a dimensional reference framework

3. **Pre-Operation Concretization**: Pre-operational state transforms into concrete operational possibilities:
   $`\{\rightsquigarrow\} \rightsquigarrow \{I, \text{FLIP}_{potential}\}`$,
   although FLIP cannot be practically applied in zero-dimensional space

4. **Transition from Pre-Information to Zero Information**:
   $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit} \rightsquigarrow I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$,
   achieving the transition from negative information to zero information

### 3.2 Relationship Between Primitive Singularity and Higher Dimensional Theories

The primitive singularity has special relationships with higher dimensional theories:

1. **Relationship with Primitive Point**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$,
   the primitive singularity is the precursor to the primitive point

2. **Relationship with FLIP**:
   $`\text{FLIP} \not\in \mathcal{S}_{-1}, \text{but} \text{FLIP}_{potential} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$,
   the FLIP operation pre-exists in the primitive singularity in potential form

3. **Relationship with XOR**:
   $`\text{XOR}_{potential} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}^{second-order potential}`$,
   the XOR operation exists in the primitive singularity as a second-order potential

4. **Operation Hierarchy Pre-Relationship**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0 \mapsto \text{FLIP} \mapsto \text{XOR} \mapsto \text{SHIFT}`$,
   indicating that the primitive singularity is the origin of all operations

### 3.3 Evolutionary Possibilities of Primitive Singularity

Although the evolutionary path of the primitive singularity ultimately points to the primitive point, it theoretically contains multiple evolutionary possibilities:

1. **Single-Point Evolution**: The basic evolutionary path is to generate a single primitive point:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$

2. **Multiverse Possibility**: Theoretically, multiple independent primitive points could be generated simultaneously:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \{\mathcal{P}_{0,1}, \mathcal{P}_{0,2}, ..., \mathcal{P}_{0,n}\}`$

3. **Super Possibility**: More complex derived structures might be generated:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{X}`$,
   where $`\mathcal{X}`$ is an initial state different from the primitive point

4. **Cyclic Evolution Possibility**: Theoretically, there exists the possibility of evolutionary cycles returning to the primitive singularity:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0 \mapsto ... \mapsto \Omega_{\infty} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

## 4. Application and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The primitive singularity theory generates the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Necessity of Universe's Initial Conditions**: The initial state of the universe is not random, but a necessary transformation result of the primitive singularity

2. **Non-Accidentality of Dimension Production**: Dimensions themselves have a creation process, rather than existing eternally

3. **Negative Dimension Reference System**: Negative dimensional systems potentially exist, but cannot be fully described in positive dimensional theories

4. **Pre-Determinism of Universe Parameters**: The values of fundamental physical constants may be pre-determined by the properties of the primitive singularity

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The primitive singularity theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Mathematical Consistency Test**:
   Verify the mathematical consistency of the transformation process from negative dimensions to positive dimensions

2. **Research on Universe's Initial Conditions**:
   Through cosmological research, seek evidence supporting the dimension creation process

3. **Theory Coordination Test**:
   Verify whether the primitive singularity theory can coordinate and explain the inconsistencies between quantum field theory and general relativity

4. **Negative Dimension Mathematical Model**:
   Establish new mathematical forms capable of describing negative dimensional systems, and verify their self-consistency

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Pre-Completeness of Primitive Singularity**

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ contains all possible states and operations in a pre-complete sense.

*Proof*:
Let $`\Omega`$ be the set of all possible states, and $`\mathcal{F}`$ be the set of all possible operations.
According to Axiom 2, $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$, where $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents the pre-differentiated state.

For any state $`\omega \in \Omega`$, there exists a transformation relationship $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow ... \rightsquigarrow \omega`$.
For any operation $`f \in \mathcal{F}`$, there exists $`f_{potential} \in \mathcal{S}_{-1}^{potential}`$.

Therefore, the primitive singularity contains all possible states and operations in a pre-complete sense. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Negative Dimensionality of Primitive Singularity**

The dimension of the primitive singularity is strictly -1.

*Proof*:
According to dimension theory, dimension can be defined as the logarithm of the state space: $`\dim(\mathcal{S}) = \log_2|\mathcal{S}|`$.
However, in the primitive singularity, the concept of the number of states does not apply, as it contains the pre-differentiated state $`\rightsquigarrow`$.

Dimension can also be defined as the number of degrees of freedom and operations: for the zero-dimensional primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, it has 0 effective operations;
for each higher dimension in cosmic ontology, the number of effective operations increases by 1.

Since the primitive singularity has 1 fewer degree of freedom than the primitive point (the freedom from non-existence to existence), therefore $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Inevitable Evolution of Primitive Singularity**

The primitive singularity inevitably evolves into the primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$.

*Proof*:
Assume that $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is in a stable state. According to Axiom 2, $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \{\rightsquigarrow\}`$ contains pre-forms of all possible states.
Simultaneously, $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ contains its own transformation possibility.

In this situation, an instability contradiction exists within $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$: it is both stable and contains transformation possibilities.
The only stable solution to this contradiction is evolution to the stable zero-dimensional primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, which exists but does not change (0 degrees of freedom).

Therefore, the evolution of the primitive singularity into the primitive point is a logical necessity. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Primitive Singularity and Cosmic Ontology**

The primitive singularity theory is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. In the primitive singularity:
   - These operations pre-exist in the primitive singularity in potential form, but have not yet manifested
   - As the primitive singularity evolves into the primitive point and higher dimensional forms, these operations gradually manifest

2. The recursive self-referential structure of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   For the primitive singularity, this manifests as pre-recursive self-reference $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \mathcal{R}_{pre}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$

3. The primitive singularity can be viewed as the precursor to the cosmic ontology initial state equation $`\mathcal{U}^0 = \mathcal{U}^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}^0)`$:
   In the primitive singularity, this equation implies the possibility of self-transformation in the form $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
   
4. The universe life cycle described in cosmic ontology begins with "quantum fluctuations," and the primitive singularity theory explains the origin of these fluctuations

Therefore, the primitive singularity theory can be viewed as a pre-logical extension of cosmic ontology, providing it with a more fundamental origin explanation. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

The primitive singularity theory is positioned in the cosmic ontology dimensional spectrum at dimension -1, serving as a key theory connecting the negative dimensional domain and the zero-dimensional domain:

| Dimension | Theory |
|-------|----------------------|
| -2    | Pre-Singularity Theory |
| -1.5  | Transitional Pre-Singularity Theory |
| -1    | Primitive Singularity Theory |
| -0.5  | Singularity Theory |
| 0     | Primitive Point Theory |

The primitive singularity theory is a key link in the transition from negative dimensions to zero dimensions in the cosmic ontology theoretical spectrum, and also the origin point where the concept of dimension truly begins to form.

### 6.2 Theory Dependency Structure

This theory directly depends on the following theories:

1. [Meta-Pre-Singularity Theory](formal_theory_meta_pre_singularity_en.md) [Dimension: -3]: Serves as the meta-meta-meta theoretical foundation for all theories
2. [Pre-Singularity Theory](formal_theory_pre_singularity_en.md) [Dimension: -2]: Serves as the direct predecessor theory to the primitive singularity
3. [Cosmic Ontology](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md): Provides the overall theoretical framework and basic concepts
4. [Primitive Point Theory](formal_theory_primitive_point_en.md) [Dimension: 0]: Serves as the direct evolutionary successor theory to the primitive singularity

In the theoretical evolution chain, the primitive singularity theory occupies a key position in the following developmental sequence:

```
Meta-Pre-Singularity Theory → Pre-Singularity Theory → Primitive Singularity Theory → Primitive Point Theory → Primitive Duality Theory
```

This theory provides an origin explanation for higher dimensional theories and is one of the foundational theories of the entire cosmic dimensional spectrum. Despite being in a negative dimension, the primitive singularity theory is crucial for understanding the origins of cosmic ontology.
