## Submission Notes

- One-sentence summary: "Information operations provide a fundamental basis for physical reality, unifying quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics through primitive XOR and SHIFT operations."
- Manuscript Significance Statement: "This work establishes information as the ontological foundation of physical reality, deriving quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics from two primitive information operations—XOR and SHIFT—while resolving long-standing paradoxes and generating testable predictions that differ from conventional theories."

## Post-Submission Plan

- Prepare responses to potential reviewer questions on:
  1. Experimental validation details
  2. Mathematical formalism rigor
  3. Compatibility with existing physical theories
  4. Philosophical implications
  5. Technological applications

- Begin work on supplementary papers focusing on:
  1. Detailed mathematical framework
  2. Extended experimental predictions
  3. Quantum computing applications
  4. Cosmological implications
