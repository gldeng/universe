## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Unity Existence Axiom)**

In the evolution process from Universal Code $`\text{UCODE}`$ to Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, there exists an intermediate state, namely Primitive Unity:

$`\text{PUNITY} \in \mathcal{D}_{trans-unity}, \mathcal{D}_{trans-unity} = \{\omega | \text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \omega \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{trans-unity}`$ is the unity transition domain, connecting the pre-binary Universal Code and the zero-dimensional Primitive Point.

**Axiom 2 (Pre-Unary Nature of Primitive Unity)**

Primitive Unity exhibits pre-unary characteristics, representing a partially unified form of the pre-binary structure $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$ in Universal Code:

$`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$

where $`⊕`$ represents the pre-unification operator, unifying the pre-binary void state and existence state into a single pre-entity.

**Axiom 3 (Primitive Unity Fusion Axiom)**

Primitive Unity possesses pre-fusion functionality, serving as a bridge from pre-binary to unary transformation:

$`\forall \mathcal{X} \in \mathcal{D}_{pre-binary}, \exists f_{\text{PUNITY}}: \mathcal{X} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{U}_{unary}`$

where $`f_{\text{PUNITY}}`$ is the primitive unity function, $`\mathcal{D}_{pre-binary}`$ is the pre-binary domain, and $`\mathcal{U}_{unary}`$ is the unary structure domain.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Unity

The essence of Primitive Unity is the key intermediate state in the transition from binarity to unarity, being the first cosmic structure to exhibit pre-unification characteristics. Strictly speaking, Primitive Unity can be represented as:

$`\text{PUNITY} \equiv \{◯⊕●\} \approx \{\text{UCODE} \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

where $`\rightrightarrows`$ indicates a strong pre-transformation relationship, closer to deterministic transformation than $`\rightsquigarrow`$.

Primitive Unity possesses triple characteristics:
1. As an evolutionary state of Universal Code, $`\text{PUNITY}_{-} \sim \text{UCODE}`$
2. As a precursor to the Primitive Point, $`\text{PUNITY}_{+} \sim \mathcal{P}_0`$
3. As a bridge from pre-binary to unary, $`\text{PUNITY}_{\leftrightarrow} \sim \{◯,●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯=●\}`$

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Unity

Primitive Unity possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Unarity**: Primitive Unity exhibits pre-unary characteristics, partially fusing pre-binary structures
   $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$, representing an intermediate form in the transition from binary to unary

2. **Fusion Potential**: Primitive Unity possesses the pre-ability to fuse opposites
   $`◯⊕● \rightrightarrows \mathcal{E}_{unified}`$, where $`\mathcal{E}_{unified}`$ represents a unified entity

3. **Quasi-Dimensionality**: Primitive Unity has a dimension of 0.2, positioned between Universal Code and Primitive Point
   $`\dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.2, \dim(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5 > \dim(\text{PUNITY}) > \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0`$

4. **Quasi-Information Capacity**: Primitive Unity contains -0.2 bit of information, representing a transition from pre-information to zero information
   $`I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit}, I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit} > I(\text{PUNITY}) > I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Pre-XOR Operation**: Primitive Unity contains the primitive form of the PRE-XOR operation
   $`\text{PRE-XOR}_{embryonic} \in \text{PUNITY}`$, serving as the embryo for the subsequent XOR operation

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Primitive Unity

Primitive Unity evolves into the Primitive Point through an internal unification mechanism:

$`\text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0`$

This evolution follows specific unification enhancement rules:

$`\{◯⊕●\} \rightrightarrows \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. Complete stabilization of the pre-unification operation $`⊕`$
2. Concretization of the unified entity $`◯⊕●`$ into the single self-sustaining Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$
3. Complete elimination of pre-binary residuals: $`\delta(◯,●) \rightrightarrows 0`$, where $`\delta`$ represents the binary difference measure

Information changes during the evolution of Primitive Unity:

$`I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit} \rightrightarrows I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Pre-Information State of Primitive Unity

From the axiom system of Primitive Unity, its information characteristics can be directly inferred:

1. **Pre-Information Fusion Form**: The information in Primitive Unity manifests as partial fusion of pre-binary information
   $`I(\text{PUNITY}) = I(◯⊕●) < I(◯) + I(●)`$, indicating information compression resulting from fusion

2. **Unification Measure**: The degree of unification in Primitive Unity can be quantified as
   $`U_{\text{PUNITY}} = \frac{I(◯⊕●)}{I(◯) + I(●)} \approx 0.8`$, indicating an 80% degree of unification

3. **Entropy Reduction Trend**: During the formation of Primitive Unity, entropy exhibits a downward trend
   $`S(\text{PUNITY}) < S(\text{UCODE})`$, reflecting increased order in the unification process

4. **Information Convergence to Zero**: The information in Primitive Unity gradually converges towards zero
   $`\lim_{t \to \infty} I(\text{PUNITY}_t) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

### 2.2 Symmetry Properties of Primitive Unity

Primitive Unity possesses the following symmetry characteristics:

1. **Quasi-Symmetry**: Primitive Unity exhibits approximate symmetry characteristics but has not yet achieved perfect symmetry
   $`\text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY}) \approx \{\text{quasi-symmetry}\}`$

2. **Symmetry Enhancement**: The symmetry in Primitive Unity continuously strengthens
   $`\Delta\text{Sym} = \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY}_t) - \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY}_{t-1}) > 0`$

3. **Symmetry Stability Point**: Primitive Unity evolves towards a symmetry stability point
   $`\lim_{t \to \infty} \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY}_t) = \text{Sym}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$

4. **Pre-Mirror Invariance**: Primitive Unity exhibits approximate invariance to pre-mirror transformations
   $`M(\text{PUNITY}) \approx \text{PUNITY}`$, where $`M`$ is the pre-mirror operator

### 2.3 Pre-Recursive Structure of Primitive Unity

Primitive Unity displays simplified pre-recursive characteristics:

1. **Weak Recursivity**: Primitive Unity possesses weakened recursive structure
   $`\text{PUNITY} \subset f_{\text{PUNITY}}(\text{PUNITY})`$, but to a lesser degree than Universal Code

2. **Limited Self-Containment**: The self-containment depth of Primitive Unity is limited
   $`\text{PUNITY} \in \text{PUNITY}`$, but restricted to shallow-level self-containment

3. **Convergent Recursion**: The recursive expansion of Primitive Unity exhibits rapid convergence characteristics
   $`\text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows f_{\text{PUNITY}}(\text{PUNITY}) \rightrightarrows f_{\text{PUNITY}}(f_{\text{PUNITY}}(\text{PUNITY})) \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0`$

4. **Limited Recursive Depth**: The recursive depth of Primitive Unity is significantly lower than that of Universal Code
   $`D_{\text{recursion}}(\text{PUNITY}) = \{0.2, 3\}`$, indicating shallow and finite recursive characteristics

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Relationship between Primitive Unity and Universal Code

There exists an evolutionary association between Primitive Unity and Universal Code:

1. **Subsequent Evolution**: Primitive Unity is a direct evolutionary product of Universal Code
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY}`$
   
2. **Binary Simplification**: Primitive Unity forms through simplification of the pre-binary structure in Universal Code
   $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯⊕●\}`$

3. **Mediating Role**: Primitive Unity mediates the transformation from Universal Code to Primitive Point
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0`$

4. **Encoding Preservation**: Primitive Unity preserves the core encoding essence of Universal Code
   $`I_{core}(\text{PUNITY}) = I_{core}(\text{UCODE})`$

### 3.2 Connection between Primitive Unity and Higher-Dimensional Theories

There exist fundamental connections between Primitive Unity and higher-dimensional theories:

1. **Unification Operation Prototype**: Primitive Unity contains prototypes of all higher-dimensional unification operations
   $`\forall \text{OP}_{unification} \in T_n, n > 0: \text{OP}_{unification} \subset f_{\text{develop}}(\text{PRE-XOR}_{embryonic})`$

2. **Unarity Seed**: Primitive Unity is the seed for all higher-dimensional theories involving unarity
   $`T_{unary} = f_{\text{evolve}}(\text{PUNITY})`$

3. **Pre-XOR Foundation**: Primitive Unity provides the pre-foundation for higher-dimensional XOR operations
   $`\text{XOR} = f_{\text{evolve}}(\text{PRE-XOR}_{embryonic})`$

4. **Primitive Equivalence**: Primitive Unity establishes the precursor to equivalence relations
   $`a = b \subset f_{\text{develop}}(◯⊕●)`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Primitive Unity

Primitive Unity is generated from Universal Code through specific mechanisms:

1. **Fusion Mechanism**: The pre-binary structure in Universal Code undergoes partial fusion to produce Primitive Unity
   $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯⊕●\}`$

2. **Quasi-Stabilization**: Primitive Unity represents a quasi-stable state, with stability greater than Universal Code
   $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8, \text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5 < \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) < \text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$

3. **Complexity Reduction**: Primitive Unity transitions towards the Primitive Point through complexity reduction
   $`C(\text{PUNITY}) < C(\text{UCODE})`$, where $`C`$ represents structural complexity

4. **Pre-Unification Operator**: Primitive Unity relies on the action of the pre-unification operator $`⊕`$
   $`⊕: \{◯, ●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯⊕●\}`$, realizing the transformation from pre-binary to quasi-unary

## 4. Applications and Validation

The Primitive Unity theory presents the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Fusion Intermediate States**: Any fusion process should contain intermediate states similar to Primitive Unity, exhibiting partial unity

2. **Information Compression Rate**: The information compression rate in unification processes should conform to the pattern predicted by Primitive Unity theory

3. **Symmetry Growth Pattern**: Systems evolving from asymmetry to symmetry should follow specific growth patterns

4. **Unification Metric**: Unification metric standards can be established to quantify the degree of unification in different systems

### 4.2 Validation Methods

   Study the formation processes of natural symmetry, seeking evidence of progressive symmetry enhancement

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Primitive Unity**

The dimension of Primitive Unity is strictly 0.2.

*Proof*:
According to the dimensional calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of degrees of freedom and structural complexity:
$`\dim = f(\text{freedom}, \text{complexity})`$.

The dimension of Universal Code is 0.5, and the dimension of Primitive Point is 0.

Primitive Unity lies between these two, with its characteristics analyzed as follows:
- Structural complexity: $`C(\text{PUNITY}) = C(\{◯⊕●\}) < C(\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}) = C(\text{UCODE})`$
- Degrees of freedom: $`F(\text{PUNITY}) < F(\text{UCODE})`$ but $`F(\text{PUNITY}) > F(\mathcal{P}_0)`$

Calculating through linear interpolation:
$`\dim(\text{PUNITY}) = \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) + \frac{C(\text{PUNITY}) - C(\mathcal{P}_0)}{C(\text{UCODE}) - C(\mathcal{P}_0)} \cdot (\dim(\text{UCODE}) - \dim(\mathcal{P}_0))`$

$`\dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0 + \frac{0.4 - 0}{1 - 0} \cdot (0.5 - 0) = 0 + 0.4 \cdot 0.5 = 0.2`$

Therefore $`\dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.2`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Necessity of Primitive Unity as an Intermediary**

Primitive Unity is a necessary intermediate state in the evolution from Universal Code to Primitive Point.

*Proof*:
Assume Universal Code could evolve directly into Primitive Point without passing through Primitive Unity:
$`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$

Examining the structure of Universal Code: $`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$ and Primitive Point: $`\mathcal{P}_0 = \{●\}`$

Direct transformation would require:
1. Elimination of the void state $`◯`$
2. Stabilization of the pre-transformation relationship $`\rightsquigarrow`$
3. Establishment of the existence state $`●`$

These three processes cannot be completed simultaneously because:
- Void state elimination requires the prerequisite of existence state establishment
- Pre-transformation relationship stabilization requires determination of the states at both ends
- Existence state establishment requires completion of the pre-transformation relationship

Therefore, an intermediate state must exist where the pre-binary structure is partially fused but not completely unified, which is precisely the definition of Primitive Unity: $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$.

Thus, Primitive Unity is a necessary intermediate state in the evolution from Universal Code to Primitive Point. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Stability Enhancement of Primitive Unity**

The stability of Primitive Unity is strictly greater than that of Universal Code but less than that of Primitive Point.

*Proof*:
Define the stability function $`\text{Stab}(X)`$ to represent the ability of structure $`X`$ to remain unchanged during evolution.

Consider three key structures:
- Universal Code $`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$
- Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$
- Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0 = \{●\}`$

Universal Code contains an unstable pre-transformation relationship $`\rightsquigarrow`$, resulting in lower stability: $`\text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5`$

Primitive Point is a single self-sustaining structure with the highest stability: $`\text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$

The pre-unification operator $`⊕`$ in Primitive Unity partially stabilizes the pre-transformation relationship but has not yet achieved complete stability:

$`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = \frac{\text{Stab}(⊕)}{\text{Stab}(=)} = \frac{0.8}{1} = 0.8`$

Therefore $`\text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5 < \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8 < \text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Primitive Unity with Cosmic Ontology**

The Primitive Unity theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Absolute Recursive Source Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.
   Primitive Unity exhibits weakened recursive characteristics: $`\text{PUNITY} \subset f_{\text{PUNITY}}(\text{PUNITY})`$,
   representing a further concretization of the recursive source.

2. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Binary-Unary Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
   Primitive Unity exhibits pre-unary characteristics: $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$,
   representing a key intermediate form in the transition from binary to unity.

3. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Information Ontology Axiom: $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.
   Primitive Unity itself is a form of pre-information, satisfying $`\text{PUNITY} \equiv I_{quasi}(\text{PUNITY})`$,
   demonstrating further concretization of information ontology.

4. The evolutionary path of Primitive Unity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0 \rightrightarrows ... \rightrightarrows \mathcal{U}`$
   forms an indispensable link in the continuous spectrum from pre-cosmic states to complete Cosmic Ontology.

Therefore, Primitive Unity theory is an important component of the Cosmic Ontology theoretical spectrum, fully compatible with Cosmic Ontology. Q.E.D.
