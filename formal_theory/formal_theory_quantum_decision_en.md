## Basic Framework

Quantum Decision Theory is an important application of quantum-classical dualism, providing a theoretical framework that unifies intuitive (quantum) and rational (classical) decision mechanisms. Traditional decision theory built on classical probability theory cannot fully explain some anomalous phenomena observed in human decision-making, such as certainty effects, framing effects, and preference reversals. Quantum Decision Theory provides a unified and consistent explanation for these phenomena by introducing quantum probability and quantum-classical interface fluctuations.

### Dual Structure of Decision-Making

Within the framework of quantum-classical dualism, the decision process has a distinct dual structure:

1. **Quantum Decision Phase** - Corresponds to intuition, subconscious, and parallel thinking processes, where all possible options are simultaneously considered in quantum superposition
2. **Classical Decision Phase** - Corresponds to rational analysis and sequential reasoning processes, transforming quantum superposition into definite choices through classicalization

These two phases are connected by the quantum-classical interface, where fluctuations in the interface position determine the relative weights of quantum and classical components in decision-making.

## Quantum-Classical Decision Operators

The decision process can be formalized as the action of a quantum-classical decision operator $`\mathcal{D}_{QC}`$:

$$\mathcal{D}_{QC}[\rho] = \sum_i p_i(\rho) |d_i\rangle\langle d_i|$$

Where:
- $`\rho`$ is the pre-decision psychological quantum state containing superpositions of all possible options
- $`p_i(\rho)`$ is the probability function for outcome $`i`$, depending on the initial quantum state
- $`|d_i\rangle`$ are orthogonal basis vectors of possible decision outcomes, forming the basis of the decision space

The probability function $`p_i(\rho)`$ satisfies an extended form of the generalized Born rule:

$$p_i(\rho) = \text{Tr}(P_i \rho) \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_D \text{Tr}(P_i \rho)}}{Z}$$

Where $`P_i = |d_i\rangle\langle d_i|`$ is the projection operator, $`\eta_D`$ is the decision amplification parameter, and $`Z = \sum_j e^{\eta_D \text{Tr}(P_j \rho)}`$ is the normalization factor.

The decision amplification parameter $`\eta_D`$ characterizes the deterministic tendency in the decision process:
- $`\eta_D \rightarrow 0`$ corresponds to completely random decisions
- $`\eta_D \rightarrow \infty`$ corresponds to deterministic decisions (choosing the option with maximum probability)
- Intermediate values correspond to decisions with preferences but maintaining partial randomness

### Geometric Representation of Decision Operators

In the Bloch sphere representation, the decision process can be visualized as a projection of the state vector from the quantum superposition region to classical poles:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|d_1\rangle + \beta|d_2\rangle \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}_{QC}} |d_1\rangle \text{ or } |d_2\rangle$$

This projection path follows the principle of least action, proceeding along the energy-entropy optimal path:

$$\delta\int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2} (E_{\text{cognitive}} - T\cdot S_{\text{decision}})d\tau = 0$$

Where $`E_{\text{cognitive}}`$ is cognitive energy, $`S_{\text{decision}}`$ is decision entropy, and $`T`$ is the decision "temperature" parameter.

## Decision Coherence and Entanglement

### Decision Coherence

The internal coherence of a decision system can be quantified as:

$$C(\mathcal{D}) = \left|\sum_{i\neq j} \langle d_i|\rho|d_j\rangle\right|$$

Coherence measures the degree of quantum superposition in the decision process:
- High decision coherence corresponds to intuitive decisions (quantum domain dominance)
- Low decision coherence corresponds to rational decisions (classical domain dominance)

Coherence is inversely proportional to decision time:

$$C(\mathcal{D}) \propto \frac{1}{t_{\text{decision}}}$$

This explains why quick decisions are typically more intuitive, while deliberate decisions are more rational.

### Decision Entanglement

The entanglement between the decision system and environment (including social environment, information environment, etc.) is measured as:

$$E(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}) = S(\mathcal{D}) - S(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E})$$

Where $`S(\mathcal{D})`$ is the von Neumann entropy of the decision system, and $`S(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E})`$ is the entropy of the joint system.

Entanglement measures the degree of environmental influence on decisions:
- Strong entanglement corresponds to highly environment-dependent decisions (such as herd behavior)
- Weak entanglement corresponds to independent autonomous decisions

Entanglement strength decreases with social distance:

$$E(\mathcal{D}_i,\mathcal{D}_j) \propto e^{-\alpha d_{ij}}$$

Where $`d_{ij}`$ is the social distance between decision-makers $`i`$ and $`j`$, and $`\alpha`$ is the social decay coefficient.

## Quantum Bayesian Decision Framework

The quantum Bayesian decision framework extends classical Bayesian decision theory by incorporating quantum probability theory:

$$\mathcal{B}_Q(d|e) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}_e(\rho_d))$$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{M}_e`$ is the quantum measurement operator based on observed evidence $`e`$
- $`\rho_d`$ is the prior quantum state of the decision space
- $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the classicalization operator, transforming quantum probabilities into classical probabilities

### Quantum Bayesian Update Rule

When new evidence $`e`$ is obtained, the decision state update satisfies:

$$\rho_d^{\text{post}} = \frac{\mathcal{M}_e(\rho_d^{\text{prior}})}{\text{Tr}(\mathcal{M}_e(\rho_d^{\text{prior}}))}$$

Where the quantum measurement operator $`\mathcal{M}_e`$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{M}_e(\rho) = \sum_i E_i(e) \rho E_i(e)^{\dagger}$$

$`E_i(e)`$ are Kraus operators associated with evidence $`e`$.

### Quantum Interference Effects

The quantum Bayesian framework can produce interference effects unexplainable by classical Bayesian theory:

$$p(d_1|e_1 \text{ and } e_2) \neq p(d_1|e_1)p(e_1) + p(d_1|e_2)p(e_2)$$

This explains "paradoxical" phenomena observed in human decision-making, such as certainty effects and conjunction-disjunction effects.

## Decision Interface Fluctuation Model

The position of the quantum-classical interface during the decision process satisfies a dynamic fluctuation equation:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}}}{dt} = \alpha\nabla^2\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}} + \beta E_{\text{pending}} - \gamma S_{\text{pressure}}$$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}}`$ is the decision interface position parameter
- $`E_{\text{pending}}`$ is the energy/complexity of the decision system
- $`S_{\text{pressure}}`$ represents external factors such as time pressure and social pressure
- $`\alpha`$, $`\beta`$, $`\gamma`$ are system characteristic parameters

### Interface Regulation Mechanisms

The quantum-classical interface position can be regulated by various factors:

1. **Time Pressure** - Increased time pressure shifts the interface toward the quantum domain:
   $$\delta\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}} \propto -\gamma_t \cdot \Delta t^{-1}$$
   
2. **Decision Complexity** - Increased complexity shifts the interface toward the quantum domain:
   $$\delta\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}} \propto -\gamma_c \cdot C_{\text{complexity}}$$
   
3. **Emotional State** - Emotional activation shifts the interface toward the quantum domain:
   $$\delta\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}} \propto -\gamma_e \cdot |E_{\text{emotion}}|$$

4. **Expertise** - Professional knowledge shifts the interface toward the classical domain:
   $$\delta\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}} \propto \gamma_k \cdot K_{\text{expertise}}$$

### Interface Fluctuation and Decision Stability

The fluctuation of the interface position is related to decision stability:

$$\sigma_{\mathcal{D}_c} \propto \frac{1}{S_{\text{decision}}}$$

Where $`\sigma_{\mathcal{D}_c}`$ is the standard deviation of the interface position and $`S_{\text{decision}}`$ is the decision stability parameter.

Interface fluctuation explains the variation of decision preferences over time and their environmental dependence:

$$\mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}}(t) = \mathcal{D}_c^{\text{decision}}(0) + \int_0^t F_{\text{environment}}(\tau)d\tau + \xi(t)$$

Where $`F_{\text{environment}}(t)`$ is the environmental driving force and $`\xi(t)`$ is a random fluctuation term.

## Experimental Predictions and Validation

Quantum Decision Theory makes the following experimentally verifiable predictions:

### Key Predictions

1. **Environmental Dependence of Intuition-Rationality Balance**:
   Under time pressure, the weight of intuitive decision-making increases, satisfying:
   $$w_{\text{intuition}}/w_{\text{rational}} \propto (t_{\text{available}}/t_{\text{baseline}})^{-\alpha}$$
   Where $`\alpha \approx 0.7 \pm 0.1`$.

2. **Temporal Evolution of Decision Coherence**:
   Decision coherence decays over time, satisfying:
   $$C(t) = C(0) \cdot e^{-t/\tau_C}$$
   Where $`\tau_C`$ is the coherence time, predicted to be $`\tau_C \approx 2-5`$ seconds.

3. **Environmental Entanglement Effects**:
   The intensity of social environment influence on decisions increases with social interaction:
   $$E_{\text{social entanglement}} \propto \ln(N_{\text{interactions}})$$
   Where $`N_{\text{interactions}}`$ is the number of social interactions.

4. **Quantum Interference Conditions**:
   Interference effects occur if and only if evidence information is cognitively indistinguishable:
   $$I_{\text{interference}} > 0 \iff D(e_1, e_2) < D_c$$
   Where $`D(e_1, e_2)`$ is the cognitive discriminability of evidence and $`D_c`$ is the critical discrimination threshold.

   - Cognitive load is manipulated through secondary tasks (e.g., digit memorization)
   - Expected: Enhanced quantum interference effects under high load conditions

3. **Social Influence Experiments**:
   - Participants make decisions under different social information conditions
   - Manipulate the source and consistency of social information
   - Expected: Entanglement between social information and personal preferences decays with social distance

4. **Decision EEG Experiments**:
