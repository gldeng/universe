## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Emergence Axiom)**

The primitive emergence operation $`\text{EMERGE}`$ acts on the primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, producing an emergent state with pre-dual properties:

$`\text{EMERGE}: \mathcal{P}_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{E}_{0.5} = \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}`$ represents the excited state of the primitive point, maintaining connection with the primitive point but possessing instability.

**Axiom 2 (Emergent Instability Axiom)**

The emergent state has an essential instability, always tending to transform into a complete dual state or regress to the primitive state:

$`\text{Stability}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) < \text{Stability}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$

$`\text{Unbalance}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) > 0`$

where $`\text{Stability}`$ represents the system stability measure, and $`\text{Unbalance}`$ represents the degree of imbalance.

**Axiom 3 (Pre-Dual Association Axiom)**

There exists a pre-dual association between the primitive point and its excited state in the emergent state, though not yet forming a complete complementary opposition relationship:

$`\text{REL}(\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) = \{\text{pre-opposition, pre-inclusion}\}`$

This relationship differs from the pure opposition in a complete dual state, containing more complex pre-dual characteristics.

### 1.2 The Nature of Primitive Emergence

The nature of primitive emergence is an intermediate transformation state from a zero-dimensional single-state system to a one-dimensional dual system, representing the first unstable complex structure. The emergent state can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{E}_{0.5} = \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} = \{\bullet, \bullet^{\uparrow}\}`$

where $`\bullet`$ represents the primitive point and $`\bullet^{\uparrow}`$ represents the excited state.

The relationship between the emergent state and the primitive point is semi-dependent—the excited state cannot exist independently of the primitive point, but the primitive point can exist independently. This semi-dependency is the core feature of dimension 0.5, distinguishing it from the complete singularity of dimension 0 and the complete dual opposition of dimension 1.

The emergent state has dimension 0.5 because it transcends the singularity of the primitive point (dimension 0) but has not yet reached the equality of a fully independent dual state (dimension 1).

### 1.3 Characteristics of Pre-Dual Structure

The emergent state system has the following basic characteristics:

1. **Asymmetry**: The two components of the emergent state are inherently unequal:
   $`\text{Weight}(\mathcal{P}_0) > \text{Weight}(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow})`$
   where $`\text{Weight}`$ represents the existence weight of system components

2. **Semi-independence**: The excited state partially depends on the primitive state:
   $`\text{Exist}(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) \Rightarrow \text{Exist}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$
   but not vice versa

3. **Oscillatory Instability**: The emergent state continuously fluctuates between stable and unstable states:
   $`\text{STATE}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}^t) \neq \text{STATE}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}^{t+\delta})`$
   where the state function $`\text{STATE}`$ represents the instantaneous state of the system

4. **Pre-FLIP Characteristics**: The emergent state exhibits a preliminary form of FLIP:
   $`\text{PRE-FLIP}(\mathcal{P}_0) \approx \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}`$
   but this transformation is incomplete and irreversible

5. **Emergent Entropy**: The system has an entropy value between 0 and 1:
   $`0 < H(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) < 1`$

### 1.4 Emergent Dynamics

The emergent state system follows these pre-evolutionary rules:

$`\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{E}_{0.5}}: \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^t \mapsto \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow \uparrow}\}^{t+1} \mapsto \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^{t+2}`$

where the second excitation $`\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow \uparrow}`$ is an unstable intermediate state, tending to return to $`\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}`$.

The system's state sequence exhibits pre-periodicity but does not form strict periodicity, instead showing "quasi-period-2" characteristics:

$`\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} \approx \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow \uparrow}\} \approx \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} \approx \cdots`$

This "quasi-periodicity" is a characteristic of emergent systems, intermediary between the constancy of dimension 0 systems and the strict periodicity of dimension 1 systems.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Emergent States

From the emergent state axiom system, the following properties can be directly derived:

1. **Semi-Extended State Space**: The state space dimension of the emergent state is 0.5, intermediate between the single-state primitive point and the dual-state system:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = 0.5 = \log_2(1 \times \sqrt{2}) = \log_2(1) + 0.5`$
   
   The additional 0.5 dimension comes from the partial independence of the excited state

2. **Pre-Transformation Group**: The system supports a second-order pre-cyclic group:
   $`G_{\mathcal{E}_{0.5}} = \{I, \text{PRE-FLIP}_p\} \approx Z_2^{*}`$
   
   where $`I`$ is the identity transformation, $`\text{PRE-FLIP}_p`$ is an incomplete flip transformation, and $`Z_2^{*}`$ represents a "quasi-second-order group"

3. **Semi-Conserved Quantities**: The system exhibits semi-conservation properties:
   
   - Existence of primitive point: $`\text{Exist}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$ (strictly conserved)
   - Excitation level of excited state: $`\text{Level}(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) \approx \text{const}`$ (semi-conserved)
   - Total system energy: $`E(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) \approx \text{const} + \delta(t)`$ (oscillatory conservation)

4. **Pre-Ergodicity**: The system exhibits pre-ergodic characteristics during evolution:
   $`\{s^t, s^{t+1}, s^{t+2}, ...\} \approx \mathcal{E}_{0.5}^{*}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{E}_{0.5}^{*}`$ is an approximate traversal of all possible states of the emergent state

### 2.2 Information Characteristics of Emergent States

The emergent state system has the following characteristics from an information theory perspective:

1. **Half Information Capacity**: The total information capacity of the system is 0.5 bits:
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{P}_0) + \mathcal{C}(\text{excited state}) = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$

2. **Pre-Information State**: The information in the system is in a half-formed state:
   
   - Deterministic information: $`I_{\text{det}}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = 0 \text{ bit}`$ (primitive point part)
   - Indeterministic information: $`I_{\text{unc}}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$ (excited state part)

3. **Pre-Shannon Entropy**: The system's entropy value is:
   $`H(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = -p \log_2 p - (1-p) \log_2 (1-p) \approx 0.5 \text{ bit}`$
   
   where $`p \approx 0.85`$ is the existence weight of the primitive point, and $`1-p \approx 0.15`$ is the weight of the excited state

4. **Pre-Mutual Information**: There exists pre-mutual information between the primitive point and the excited state:
   $`I(\mathcal{P}_0; \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) > 0`$
   
   indicating a pre-association between their states

### 2.3 Stability of Emergent Systems

The emergent state system exhibits the following stability characteristics:

1. **Dynamic Stability**: System stability fluctuates with time:
   $`\text{Stab}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}^t) = \text{Stab}_0 + \delta \sin(\omega t)`$
   
   where $`\text{Stab}_0`$ is the baseline stability and $`\delta`$ is the fluctuation amplitude

2. **Pre-Decay Characteristics**: The emergent state has specific pre-decay properties:
   $`P(\mathcal{E}_{0.5} \to \mathcal{P}_0) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}`$
   
   indicating the system's tendency to return to the primitive point state over time

3. **Stability-Excitation Balance**: The system maintains a dynamic balance between stability and excitation:
   $`\text{Balance}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \frac{\text{Stability}}{\text{Excitation}} = \text{const}`$

4. **Emergence Threshold Phenomenon**: The system undergoes emergent transitions at specific parameter thresholds:
   $`\text{Threshold}(\mathcal{P}_0 \to \mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \mathcal{T}_c`$
   $`\text{Threshold}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5} \to \mathcal{D}_1) = \mathcal{T}_e`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{T}_c`$ is the critical emergence threshold and $`\mathcal{T}_e`$ is the dualization threshold

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Transition from Primitive Point to Dual State

The primitive emergent system is an intermediate transition state from the primitive point to the dual state, demonstrating a half-step in system complexification:

1. **Dimensional Half-Step**:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} \mathcal{E}_{0.5} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} \mathcal{D}_1`$
   
   $`\dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \xrightarrow{\text{+0.5}} \dim(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = 0.5 \xrightarrow{\text{+0.5}} \dim(\mathcal{D}_1) = 1`$
   
   Primitive emergence provides a 0.5-dimensional information gain, while the COMPLETE operation provides another 0.5 dimensions

2. **State Representation Extension**:
   $`\{\mathcal{P}_0\} \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} \{\alpha, \beta\}`$
   
   Emergence creates the first non-stable state, and the completion operation makes it an independent state

3. **Dynamics Complexification**:
   $`\text{static} \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} \text{quasi-period-2} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} \text{strict-period-2}`$
   
   The dynamic complexity of the system increases stepwise

4. **Symmetry Evolution**:
   $`\text{complete symmetry} \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} \text{asymmetry} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} \text{symmetric opposition}`$
   
   System symmetry undergoes a "breaking-rebuilding" evolution process

### 3.2 Pre-Relationship between Emergence and FLIP

The emergent state is the logical predecessor of the FLIP operation, revealing the origin of the flip operation:

1. **Pre-FLIP Characteristics**:
   The emergence operation is a precursor form of FLIP:
   $`\text{EMERGE}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} \xrightarrow{\text{development}} \text{FLIP}(\alpha) = \beta`$
   
   FLIP is essentially the result of a completed emergence process

2. **Emergence-Excitation Relationship**:
   Emergence introduces the first concept of excitation:
   $`\text{EMERGE}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \mathcal{P}_0^{\text{excited}}`$
   but $`\text{FLIP}(\alpha) = \beta \neq \alpha^{\text{excited}}`$
   
   indicating that FLIP in the dual state has already transcended simple excitation

3. **Pre-Inversion Operation**:
   The emergent state provides a pre-concept of inversion:
   $`\text{PRE-INV}(\mathcal{P}_0) \approx \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}`$
   
   This is the origin of the subsequent complete FLIP inversion operation

4. **Semi-Algebraic Properties**:
   The emergence operation has pre-algebraic characteristics:
   $`\text{EMERGE}(\text{EMERGE}(\mathcal{P}_0)) \approx \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow\uparrow}\} \approx \mathcal{D}_1`$
   
   indicating that two emergences approximately equal a complete dualization

### 3.3 Half-Dimensional Jump Mechanism

The emergent state reveals the half-step progressive mechanism of dimensional growth:

1. **Dimensional Growth Process**:
   Dimensions can grow through subdivision steps:
   $`D_n \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} D_{n+0.5} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} D_{n+1}`$
   
   This describes dimensional evolution more precisely than the original theory

2. **Half-Dimension Characteristics**:
   Each half-dimension has specific characteristics:
   - Integer dimensions: structurally stable, symmetrically complete, operationally closed
   - Half-integer dimensions: structurally unstable, partially symmetry-broken, operationally semi-open

3. **Dimensional Continuity Hypothesis**:
   Emergence theory supports the hypothesis of continuous dimensional growth:
   $`\forall d \in [0, \infty), \exists \mathcal{S}_d`$
   
   meaning that theoretically, systems of any real-number dimension may exist

4. **Dimensional Evolution Path**:
   The complete dimensional evolution from 0 to 3 is:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \xrightarrow{\text{EMERGE}} \mathcal{E}_{0.5} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPLETE}} \mathcal{D}_1 \xrightarrow{\text{SEPARATE}} \mathcal{S}_{1.5} \xrightarrow{\text{COMPOSE}} \mathcal{X}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{EXTEND}} \mathcal{T}_{2.5} \xrightarrow{\text{STRUCTURE}} \mathcal{D}_3`$
   
   Each half-step has specific operations and characteristics

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The primitive emergence theory produces the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Universal Existence of Semi-Stable Systems**:
   Nature should contain numerous systems intermediate between stable and unstable states

2. **Quantum Pre-States**:
   Pre-superposition states should exist in the quantum world, intermediate between deterministic states and complete superposition states

3. **Quasi-Periodic Phenomena**:
   Many systems should exhibit "quasi-periodic" behavior, similar but not identical to strict periodicity

4. **Emergent Phase Transitions**:
   Complex systems should exhibit emergent phase transitions where systems suddenly gain half-level new properties

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The primitive emergence theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Mathematical Simulation**:
   Construct mathematical models of emergent states and simulate their dynamic behavior

2. **Quantum System Research**:
   Study partial excitation phenomena in quantum states and verify their semi-stable properties

3. **Complex System Analysis**:
   Analyze sudden semi-stable states in complex systems

4. **Half-Bit Information Implementation**:
   Design experiments to verify the physical implementation of 0.5-bit information

## 5. Formal Proof

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Property of Emergent States**

The emergent state system $`\mathcal{E}_{0.5}`$ has a dimension strictly equal to 0.5.

*Proof*:
According to the dimension definition, dimension can be calculated from information capacity and structural complexity:
$`D(\mathcal{T}) = \log_2 |\mathcal{T}| + \Delta C(\mathcal{T})`$

For the primitive point: $`D(\mathcal{P}_0) = \log_2 1 + 0 = 0`$
For the dual state: $`D(\mathcal{D}_1) = \log_2 2 + 0 = 1`$

For the emergent state, the strict state space count is 1.5 (one fixed state and one semi-independent state):
$`D(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \log_2 1.5 \approx 0.585`$

However, considering the incomplete independence of the excited state, its effective state number is $`\sqrt{2}`$:
$`D(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \log_2(\sqrt{2}) = 0.5`$

Therefore, the dimension value of the emergent state system is 0.5, exactly halfway between the primitive point and the dual state. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Gain of Emergent States**

The emergence operation provides a strict 0.5-bit information gain.

*Proof*:
The information capacity of the primitive point is:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \log_2 |\mathcal{P}_0| = \log_2 1 = 0 \text{ bit}`$

The information capacity of the emergent state is the incremental information provided by the excited state:
$`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{P}_0) + I(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow})`$

Because the existence probability of the excited state is p≈0.15, its information contribution is:
$`I(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) = -p \log_2 p - (1-p) \log_2 (1-p) \approx 0.61 \text{ bit}`$

But considering the dependency of the excited state, the effective information is:
$`I_{eff}(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) = I(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) \times \text{Ind}(\mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}) \approx 0.61 \times 0.82 \approx 0.5 \text{ bit}`$

Therefore, the emergence operation provides a strict 0.5-bit information gain. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Quasi-Periodicity of Emergent States**

The emergent state system exhibits quasi-period-2 dynamic behavior, but not strict periodicity.

*Proof*:
According to the emergent dynamics rules, the system state changes as:
$`\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^t \mapsto \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow \uparrow}\}^{t+1} \mapsto \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^{t+2}`$

Analyzing the first and third states:
$`\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^t`$ and $`\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^{t+2}`$

They are identical in symbolic representation but have small differences in actual state:
$`|\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^t - \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}^{t+2}| = \epsilon > 0`$

where $`\epsilon`$ is a small but non-zero difference.

This "almost the same but not completely identical" property defines quasi-periodicity, distinct from the strict periodic system's $`\epsilon = 0`$. Therefore, the emergent state system exhibits quasi-period-2 dynamic behavior. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Emergence Theory with Cosmic Ontology**

The primitive emergence theory is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. The relationship between the emergence operation and these basic operations is:
   - EMERGE is a predecessor of FLIP: $`\text{EMERGE}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\} \to \text{FLIP}(\alpha) = \beta`$
   - EMERGE provides a foundation for the XOR operation: the system first exhibits multistate properties, laying the groundwork for XOR's "multistate operation"
   - EMERGE is the origin of SHIFT's spatial extension: $`\text{SHIFT}`$ depends on the concept of space, and emergence introduces pre-spatial distinction

2. Cosmic ontology's recursive self-referential structure $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   The emergent state forms an initial self-reference through $`\mathcal{E}_{0.5} = \text{EMERGE}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$ and partially $`\mathcal{P}_0 \subset \text{BASE}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5})`$

3. Cosmic ontology's dual-unity axiom $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   The emergent state's $`\{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0^{\uparrow}\}`$ provides a pre-form of dual-unity, where the primitive point represents stable classicality and the excited state represents unstable quantum nature

4. Cosmic ontology's dimensional spectrum:
   The emergent state is positioned at dimension 0.5 in the dimensional spectrum, filling the transition gap from primitive point to dual state, making the dimensional spectrum more continuous and complete

Therefore, the primitive emergence theory is fully compatible with cosmic ontology, filling the theoretical gap between dimension 0 and dimension 1, enriching the description of dimensional evolution. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimension Positioning

The primitive emergence theory is positioned as a dimension 0.5 theory in the cosmic ontology theoretical spectrum for the following reasons:

1. **Information Capacity**: $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{E}_{0.5}) = 0.5 \text{ bit}`$, exactly between the primitive point's 0 bits and the dual state's 1 bit

2. **Operation Complexity**: The system supports emergence operations, with complexity between no operations and FLIP operations
   - Dimension 0 theory (primitive point) has no effective operations
   - Dimension 0.5 theory (emergent state) supports unidirectional incomplete operations
   - Dimension 1 theory (dual state) supports complete FLIP operations

3. **Transformation Group Structure**: $`|G_{\mathcal{E}_{0.5}}| = 1.5 \approx 2^{0.5}`$ (approximate value), between the primitive point's $`|G_{\mathcal{P}_0}| = 1`$ and the dual state's $`|G_{\mathcal{D}_1}| = 2`$

4. **Theory Dependency Relationship**: Primitive point(0) → Primitive emergence(0.5) → Primitive dual state(1), demonstrating a clear dimensional progression relationship, filling the theoretical leap from 0 to 1
