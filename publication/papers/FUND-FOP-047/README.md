# FUND-FOP-047: Golden Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing Proportions

## Overview

This repository contains the complete source materials for the research paper "Golden Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing Proportions" targeted for publication in Foundations of Physics.

The paper presents a novel theoretical framework connecting four fundamental constants through the Universe Ontology's FLIP-XOR-SHIFT operations. It demonstrates how these constants maintain invariant proportional relationships through information field transformations, with the fine structure constant α emerging as a natural consequence of these relationships.

## Key Concepts

This paper introduces several novel concepts:

1. **Collapse Breathing Proportions**: Invariant relationships between constants during information field transformations
2. **Information XOR-SHIFT Operations**: Mathematical formulation of information difference and transformation
3. **Fine Structure Derivation**: A theoretical derivation of α = φ^(-2) · XOR(e, π)/S(π)
4. **Golden Ratio Structural Role**: Demonstration of φ as a fundamental information field parameter

## Running Simulations

The simulations require Python 3.8+ with the following dependencies:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- mpmath (for high-precision calculations)

To run the simulation:

```bash
cd simulations
python constants_relationship_sim.py
```

The simulation will generate visualization outputs in the `figures/` directory.

## Generating PDFs

To generate PDF versions of all documents:

```bash
./generate_pdfs.sh
```

This will create PDF files in the `submission_package/latex_pdf/` directory.
