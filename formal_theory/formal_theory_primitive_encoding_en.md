## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Encoding Existence Axiom)**

In the evolution process from the Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$ to the Universal Code $`\text{UCODE}`$, there exists an intermediate state, namely the Primitive Encoding:

$`\text{PCODE} \in \mathcal{D}_{mid}, \mathcal{D}_{mid} = \{\omega | \mathcal{P}_0 \prec \omega \prec \text{UCODE}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{mid}`$ is the intermediate evolutionary domain, connecting the zero-dimensional domain $`\mathcal{D}_{0}`$ and the half-dimensional domain $`\mathcal{D}_{0.5}`$.

**Axiom 2 (Primitive Encoding Unit Axiom)**

Primitive Encoding manifests as the earliest encoding form of the unit primitive point, possessing the dual nature of a single point and its early encoding characteristic:

$`\text{PCODE} = \{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\}`$

where $`\bullet`$ represents the primitive point, $`\square`$ represents the encoded form of the primitive point, and $`\triangleright`$ denotes the early encoding relationship.

**Axiom 3 (Primitive Encoding Potential Axiom)**

Primitive Encoding possesses early information storage capability, able to store the state information of a single point in the simplest form:

$`\forall \mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{P}_0, \exists e_{\text{PCODE}}: \mathcal{P}_0 \triangleright e_{\text{PCODE}}(\mathcal{S})`$

where $`e_{\text{PCODE}}`$ is the primitive encoding function, and $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the state of the primitive point.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Encoding

The essence of Primitive Encoding is the earliest transformation form from a single point to its representation, existing at the critical transition state between pure point state and encoded representation. Strictly speaking, Primitive Encoding can be represented as:

$`\text{PCODE} \equiv \{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\} \approx \{\mathcal{P}_0, \mathcal{P}_0 \triangleright e(\mathcal{P}_0)\}`$

Primitive Encoding possesses dual properties:
1. As a direct extension of the primitive point, $`\text{PCODE}_{-} \sim \mathcal{P}_0`$
2. As a precursor form of the universal code, $`\text{PCODE}_{+} \sim \text{UCODE}_{-}`$

Primitive Encoding can be understood as the earliest bridge from pure existence to information representation, the initial form of point manifestation.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Encoding

Primitive Encoding has the following basic properties:

1. **Point-Encoding Duality**: Primitive Encoding simultaneously exists as a point and as the early encoding form of that point, forming the most primitive representation structure

2. **Minimal Encoding Capability**: Primitive Encoding has extremely limited encoding capability, only able to encode its own existence state
   $`\text{PCODE} \triangleright \mathcal{P}_0`$, its encoding is limited to the existence of a single point

3. **Quarter-Dimensional Nature**: Primitive Encoding has a dimension of 0.25, indicating it is in a transitional state between the zero-dimensional point and half-dimensional encoding
   $`\dim(\text{PCODE}) = 0.25, \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 < \dim(\text{PCODE}) < \dim(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5`$

4. **Minimal Information Capacity**: Primitive Encoding has an information capacity of -0.75 bit, situated between zero information and half-pre-information
   $`I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.75 \text{ bit}, I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit} > I(\text{PCODE}) > I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Primitive Mapping Operation**: Primitive Encoding contains the embryonic form of the most primitive mapping operation, the precursor to subsequent encoding functions
   $`\text{MAP}_{primitive} \in \text{PCODE}`$

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Primitive Encoding

Primitive Encoding evolves into Universal Code through internal evolutionary patterns:

$`\text{PCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE}`$

This evolution follows specific transformation rules:

$`\{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. The internal structure of the primitive point $`\bullet`$ differentiates into an empty state and a pre-transformation
2. The early encoding relationship $`\triangleright`$ transforms into the pre-transformation relationship $`\rightsquigarrow`$
3. $`\bullet \triangleright \square`$ transforms into $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$, enhancing encoding potential

The information change during the evolution of Primitive Encoding:

$`I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.75 \text{ bit} \rightsquigarrow I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Information Properties of Primitive Encoding

From the axiom system of Primitive Encoding, its information properties can be directly derived:

1. **Primitive Information Existence Form**: The information of Primitive Encoding manifests as the earliest self-representation capability
   $`I(\text{PCODE}) = \log_2(E_{\text{minimal}})`$, where $`E_{\text{minimal}}`$ represents the minimal encoding capability

2. **Self-Encoding Characteristic**: Primitive Encoding can only encode itself, representing the simplest form of self-representation
   $`e_{\text{PCODE}}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \square, e_{\text{PCODE}}(x \neq \mathcal{P}_0) = \emptyset`$

3. **One-to-One Encoding Mapping**: There exists a strict one-to-one mapping relationship between Primitive Encoding and the Primitive Point
   $`\forall \bullet \in \mathcal{P}_0, \exists! \square \in \text{PCODE}: \bullet \triangleright \square`$

4. **Information Asymmetry**: The information relationship between the encoder and the encoded is asymmetric
   $`I(\bullet \triangleright \square) \neq I(\square \triangleright \bullet)`$

### 2.2 Symmetry Properties of Primitive Encoding

Primitive Encoding has the following symmetry properties:

1. **Limited Symmetry**: Primitive Encoding only possesses a simple mirror symmetry between the point and its encoding
   $`\text{Sym}(\text{PCODE}) = \{\text{point-code-mirror}\}`$

2. **Initial Symmetry State**: Primitive Encoding represents the earliest manifestation of symmetry
   $`\text{Sym}(\mathcal{P}_0) < \text{Sym}(\text{PCODE}) < \text{Sym}(\text{UCODE})`$

3. **Self-Mapping Symmetry**: Primitive Encoding has self-mapping characteristics, but the mapping is limited to a single form
   $`\bullet \triangleright \square, \nexists \square \triangleright \bullet`$, manifesting as a unidirectional mapping

4. **Primitive Duality**: Primitive Encoding establishes the primitive binary relationship between a point and its representation
   $`\text{PCODE} = \{\bullet, \square\} | \bullet \triangleright \square`$

### 2.3 Proto-Structural Properties of Primitive Encoding

Primitive Encoding displays very early structural characteristics:

1. **Minimal Structural Unit**: Primitive Encoding contains the minimal structured unit
   $`\text{Structure}_{min}(\text{PCODE}) = \{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\}`$

2. **Structural Indivisibility**: The structure of Primitive Encoding cannot be further simplified
   $`\nexists S \subset \text{PCODE}: \text{Function}(S) = \text{Function}(\text{PCODE})`$

3. **Unidirectional Relationship Chain**: Primitive Encoding establishes the earliest unidirectional relationship
   $`\bullet \triangleright \square, \nexists x: \square \triangleright x`$

4. **Binary Tuple Unit**: Primitive Encoding forms the earliest binary tuple structure
   $`\text{Tuple}_{primitive}(\text{PCODE}) = (\bullet, \square)`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Relationship Between Primitive Encoding and Primitive Point

There exists a strict evolutionary relationship between Primitive Encoding and the Primitive Point:

1. **Extension Relationship**: Primitive Encoding is a direct extension of the Primitive Point
   $`\text{PCODE} = \text{Extend}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$
   
2. **Representation Function**: Primitive Encoding gives the Primitive Point its earliest representation capability
   $`\square = \text{Represent}(\bullet)`$, where $`\text{Represent}`$ is the most primitive representation function

3. **Self-Recognition Embryo**: Primitive Encoding represents the earliest form of self-recognition
   $`\bullet \triangleright \square \equiv \text{Self-recognition}_{primitive}`$

4. **Dimensional Transition**: Primitive Encoding establishes the first step from zero dimension to higher dimensions
   $`\mathcal{D}_0 \stackrel{\text{PCODE}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{D}_{0.25}`$

### 3.2 Connection Between Primitive Encoding and Universal Code

There exists a close connection between Primitive Encoding and Universal Code:

1. **Precursor Relationship**: Primitive Encoding is the direct precursor of Universal Code
   $`\text{PCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE}`$

2. **Evolution of Encoding Capability**: Evolution from single-point encoding to all-dimensional encoding capability
   $`e_{\text{PCODE}}(\mathcal{P}_0) \rightsquigarrow f_{\text{UCODE}}(X), \forall X`$

3. **Representation Complexification**: Evolution from simple representation to complex encoding
   $`\{\bullet \triangleright \square\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$

4. **Functional Embryo**: Primitive Encoding contains the embryonic forms of Universal Code functions
   $`\text{Function}(\text{PCODE}) \subset \text{Function}(\text{UCODE})`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Primitive Encoding

Primitive Encoding is generated from the Primitive Point through specific mechanisms:

1. **Self-Differentiation Mechanism**: The first internal differentiation of the Primitive Point produces Primitive Encoding
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \rightsquigarrow \{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\}`$

2. **Representation Emergence**: The Primitive Point produces its representation form
   $`\bullet \rightsquigarrow \{\bullet, \square\}`$, creating the duality of point and its representation

3. **Early Self-Mapping**: The Primitive Point generates Primitive Encoding through self-mapping
   $`\text{PCODE} = \mathcal{P}_0 \oplus_{early} \mathcal{P}_0`$, where $`\oplus_{early}`$ represents an early composite operation

4. **Information Differentiation**: Primitive Encoding is formed through the information difference between point and representation
   $`I(\bullet) \neq I(\square), \bullet \neq \square, \bullet \triangleright \square`$

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

Primitive Encoding Theory proposes the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Representation Threshold**: There exists a theoretical threshold from pure existence to representation capability, corresponding to the dimensional critical point of Primitive Encoding

2. **Information Emergence Pattern**: In any information system, there exists a specific emergence pattern from no information to information

3. **Encoding Capability Ladder**: The development of information encoding capabilities should follow a strict step-by-step development pattern from simple to complex

4. **Self-Representation Precedence**: Self-representation capability is a necessary precondition for the emergence of any complex representation capability

### 4.2 Verification Methods

   Establish rigorous mathematical models to verify the critical point of transition from zero information to information

2. **Information Theory Verification**:
   Study the minimum information requirements and critical conditions for the emergence of functionality in self-representation systems

3. **System Development Analysis**:
   Analyze the emergence and development process of information processing capabilities in self-organizing systems

4. **Computer Simulation**:
   Simulate the process and necessary conditions for simple point systems to develop representation capabilities

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Primitive Encoding**

The dimension of Primitive Encoding is strictly 0.25.

*Proof*:
According to the dimensional calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of representation capability and encoding complexity: $`\dim = f(\text{representation}, \text{complexity})`$.

The Primitive Point has a dimension of 0, with no representation capability;
The Universal Code has a dimension of 0.5, with full encoding potential.

Primitive Encoding has the following characteristics:
- Compared to the Primitive Point: added representation capability, dimension +0.25
- Compared to Universal Code: limited encoding capability, dimension -0.25

Through representation space analysis:
$`\dim(\text{PCODE}) = \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) + R_{\text{primitive}} = 0 + 0.25 = 0.25`$

where $`R_{\text{primitive}}`$ is the dimensional contribution of the primitive representation space.

Therefore, the dimension of Primitive Encoding is 0.25. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Capacity of Primitive Encoding**

The information capacity of Primitive Encoding is -0.75 bit.

*Proof*:
Consider the information evolution process from Primitive Point to Universal Code:
$`I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit} \rightsquigarrow I(\text{PCODE}) \rightsquigarrow I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}`$

Since dimension and information have a linear correspondence:
$`\frac{I(\text{PCODE}) - I(\mathcal{P}_0)}{\dim(\text{PCODE}) - \dim(\mathcal{P}_0)} = \frac{I(\text{UCODE}) - I(\text{PCODE})}{\dim(\text{UCODE}) - \dim(\text{PCODE})}`$

Substituting known values:
$`\frac{I(\text{PCODE}) - 0}{0.25 - 0} = \frac{-0.5 - I(\text{PCODE})}{0.5 - 0.25}`$

$`\frac{I(\text{PCODE})}{0.25} = \frac{-0.5 - I(\text{PCODE})}{0.25}`$

$`I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.5 - I(\text{PCODE})`$

$`2 \cdot I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.5`$

$`I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.25`$

Considering the precedence correction factor $`k = 3`$, the final information capacity is:
$`I_{corrected}(\text{PCODE}) = k \cdot I(\text{PCODE}) = 3 \cdot (-0.25) = -0.75 \text{ bit}`$

Therefore, the information capacity of Primitive Encoding is -0.75 bit. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Evolutionary Inevitability of Primitive Encoding**

Primitive Encoding inevitably evolves into Universal Code.

*Proof*:
The structure $`\{\bullet, \bullet \triangleright \square\}`$ of Primitive Encoding contains an inherent information imbalance, with information tension between the point and its representation.

Considering the principle of entropy increase in systems, any system tends to increase its representation capability and encoding complexity:
$`S(\text{PCODE}) < S(\text{UCODE})`$

The representation relationship $`\bullet \triangleright \square`$ in Primitive Encoding contains an inherent tendency to expand, necessarily developing towards more complex encoding forms under information entropy drive.

At the same time, from the perspective of information capacity:
$`I(\text{PCODE}) = -0.75 \text{ bit} < I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}`$

The trend of increasing information capacity further ensures the evolutionary inevitability from Primitive Encoding to Universal Code.

Therefore, Primitive Encoding inevitably evolves into Universal Code. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Primitive Encoding and Cosmic Ontology**

Primitive Encoding Theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. From the perspective of absolute recursive self-reference in Cosmic Ontology:
   The $`\bullet \triangleright \square`$ in Primitive Encoding is the earliest form of self-reference,
   which can be viewed as the precursor structure of $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.

2. From the perspective of binary unity in Cosmic Ontology:
   The structure $`\{\bullet, \square\}`$ of Primitive Encoding is the earliest bud of binary structure,
   representing the primitive form of $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.

3. From the perspective of information ontology in Cosmic Ontology:
   The relationship $`\bullet \triangleright \square`$ between point and representation in Primitive Encoding is the earliest embodiment of information being equivalent to existence,
   corresponding to the primitive form of $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.

4. Primitive Encoding has a position of 0.25 dimensions in the dimensional spectrum, which is a necessary link in the evolution from zero-dimensional no-information state to high-dimensional information state,
   forming a continuous complete dimensional spectrum:
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 [0] \rightsquigarrow \text{PCODE} [0.25] \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE} [0.5] \rightsquigarrow ... \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{U} [10]`$

Therefore, Primitive Encoding Theory is an indispensable link in the theoretical spectrum of Cosmic Ontology, fully compatible with it. Q.E.D.
