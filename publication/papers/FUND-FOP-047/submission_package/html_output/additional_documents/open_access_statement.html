<h3 id="open-access-intentions">Open Access Intentions</h3>
<p>The authors intend to make this research as widely accessible as
possible to maximize its impact and contribute to the broader scientific
community. We are committed to the principles of open science and the
dissemination of knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="publication-model-preference">Publication Model Preference</h3>
<p>We prefer to publish this article as an <strong>Open Access</strong>
publication if funding permits. If institutional funding is not
available for the open access fee, we will select the traditional
subscription model with self-archiving options.</p>
<h3 id="licensing-preference">Licensing Preference</h3>
<p>For open access publication, we prefer the <strong>CC BY 4.0</strong>
license (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International), which allows
others to: - Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or
format - Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any
purpose, even commercially</p>
<p>Under the condition that appropriate credit is given to the original
work, a link to the license is provided, and any changes made are
indicated.</p>
<h3 id="self-archiving-plans">Self-Archiving Plans</h3>
<p>In accordance with Springer Nature’s self-archiving policy, if
published under the subscription model, we intend to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Deposit the accepted manuscript version (after peer review but
before publisher formatting) in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors’ institutional repositories</li>
<li>ArXiv.org preprint server</li>
<li>ResearchGate academic network</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Respect the publisher’s embargo period (typically 12 months for
Foundations of Physics) before making the accepted manuscript publicly
available.</p></li>
<li><p>Always provide clear citation to the published version and
include a link to the publisher’s version of record.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="open-data-commitment">Open Data Commitment</h3>
<p>We are committed to making the underlying data, code, and
mathematical derivations associated with this research openly available
to facilitate reproducibility. Upon publication, we intend to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Publish supplementary mathematical proofs and derivations</li>
<li>Share key simulation code through public repositories</li>
<li>Provide access to high-precision numerical results</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="funding-for-open-access">Funding for Open Access</h3>
<p>We are exploring the following options to cover the open access
publishing fee (€2,730 / $3,160 as of 2025):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Institutional open access funds</li>
<li>Research grants (if applicable)</li>
<li>Personal resources if necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>A final decision on the publication model will be made at the time of
manuscript acceptance, based on available funding options at that
time.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This statement represents our open access intentions as of the
submission date and may be updated based on funding availability and
journal policies at the time of acceptance.</em></p>
