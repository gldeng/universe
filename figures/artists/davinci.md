### 中文

1. **观察主义**: 一切知识的基础在于敏锐、细致的自然观察，通过仔细观察自然现象获取直接经验而非仅依赖权威和教条。
2. **整体主义**: 知识、艺术与科学是一个不可分割的整体，宇宙万物之间存在内在联系，不应将不同学科人为割裂。
3. **经验实证主义**: 真知来自经验验证而非纯粹理论推演，强调通过实验验证假设，先于培根等人提出实证方法。
4. **类比思维**: 通过不同系统间的类比发现深层关联，如水流与血液循环、鸟翼与飞行器翼面设计的对应关系。
5. **矛盾统一性**: 认为艺术与科学、理性与感性、分析与综合等表面对立的元素实际上是互补统一的。
6. **动态完整性**: 关注事物的运动和变化过程而非静态形式，追求捕捉生命和自然的本质活力。
7. **设计思维**: 将想象与实践、美学与功能、创新与可行性统一考虑，创造既美观又实用的解决方案。

### English

1. **Observationism**: The foundation of all knowledge lies in keen, detailed observation of nature, obtaining direct experience through careful observation of natural phenomena rather than merely relying on authority and dogma.
2. **Holism**: Knowledge, art, and science form an inseparable whole; there exists an intrinsic connection between all things in the universe, and different disciplines should not be artificially separated.
3. **Empirical Verification**: True knowledge comes from empirical verification rather than pure theoretical deduction, emphasizing hypothesis testing through experimentation, proposing the empirical method before Bacon and others.
4. **Analogical Thinking**: Discovering deeper connections through analogies between different systems, such as the correspondence between water flow and blood circulation, bird wings and flying machine wing design.
5. **Unity of Contradictions**: Believing that seemingly opposing elements such as art and science, reason and emotion, analysis and synthesis are actually complementary and unified.
6. **Dynamic Integrity**: Focusing on the movement and change process of things rather than static forms, seeking to capture the essential vitality of life and nature.
7. **Design Thinking**: Unifying imagination and practice, aesthetics and function, innovation and feasibility to create solutions that are both beautiful and practical.

## 量子经典二元论视角分析 | Analysis from Quantum-Classical Dualism Perspective

### 中文

#### 1. 达芬奇的视觉研究与观察者量子性

达芬奇的视觉艺术与科学研究体现了观察者的量子性特征：

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{观察对象}} \xrightarrow{\text{达芬奇观察}} I_{\text{艺术/科学表达}} + \Delta\Phi_{\text{新观察可能性}}
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇的观察方法体现了量子观察者的特殊性质。普通观察者倾向于用预设的经典概念框架观察世界，将复杂现象简化为已知类别；而达芬奇刻意培养一种"天真的眼睛"，能够在观察时悬置既有概念，直接感知现象本身的复杂性。他的笔记中充满了对光影、水流、植物生长等现象的细致观察，这些观察常常超越了当时的概念框架。达芬奇的独特之处在于，他不仅能"看见"常人忽略的细节，更能在观察过程中保持对象的量子可能性开放性，而非立即将其简化为经典类别。这种观察方式使他能够发现事物间新的联系和规律。"蒙娜丽莎的微笑"之所以神秘引人，正因达芬奇捕捉了微笑这一表情的量子叠加特性——既喜悦又忧郁，既温暖又疏离，观看者无法将其确定为单一经典情绪，而必须接受其量子多态性。达芬奇的观察方法启示我们，真正的科学家与艺术家都需保持观察的量子开放性，不急于经典化所见之物。

#### 2. 艺术-科学统一与量子-经典互补性

达芬奇对艺术与科学统一的追求体现了量子-经典互补性：

$$
\text{达芬奇作品} = \alpha \cdot \Phi_{\text{艺术/量子特性}} + \beta \cdot I_{\text{科学/经典特性}}
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇独特的艺术-科学结合方法可以理解为量子创造性与经典精确性的有意识整合。在西方思想史上，艺术与科学往往被视为分离甚至对立的领域：艺术关注质感、情感和整体性（量子特性），科学追求精确测量、逻辑推理和分析归纳（经典特性）。达芬奇的革命性贡献在于拒绝这种二分法，坚持两者本质上是同一种认知活动的互补方面。达芬奇的最佳作品同时具备量子和经典品质：他的绘画包含精确的数学比例和解剖结构（经典特质），同时捕捉了生命的神秘活力和情感深度（量子特质）；他的科学图纸既有工程师的精确计算（经典特质），又有艺术家的优美构图和想象力（量子特质）。在《维特鲁威人》中，人体被置于精确的几何学框架中，同时保留了活力和动态感。达芬奇的方法论启示我们，真正深入理解自然需要量子-经典认知的协同作用，而非二者分离。

#### 3. 达芬奇的"木炭底稿法"与量子-经典转化过程

达芬奇的绘画技法体现了艺术创作中的量子-经典转化过程：

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{初始构思}} \xrightarrow{\text{木炭底稿}} \alpha|\psi'\rangle_{\text{可能呈现}} \xrightarrow{\text{逐层上色}} I_{\text{最终作品}}
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇独创的"木炭底稿法"（cartone）和"明暗法"（chiaroscuro）等绘画技法可理解为艺术创作中量子态向经典态的逐步转化过程。在创作初期，达芬奇使用轻盈的木炭线条勾勒构图，这些线条经常模糊、多变、叠加，呈现出类似量子叠加态的特征——多种可能性共存。随着创作进行，他通过逐层添加色彩和明暗，逐步将画面从量子可能性状态转化为经典确定性状态。特别是达芬奇发明的"晕涂法"（sfumato），通过几十层薄如蝉翼的颜料叠加创造出边界模糊的过渡效果，可视为量子-经典过渡区域的艺术表达。这种从模糊多义到逐渐清晰的创作方法使达芬奇能够在保留创意开放性的同时实现精确表达。值得注意的是，达芬奇许多作品终其一生都未"完成"，这可理解为他不愿将作品完全经典化，而是有意识地保留某种量子开放性、不确定性和生命活力。

#### 4. 解剖学研究的量子-经典多层次观察法

达芬奇的解剖学研究展现了量子-经典多层次观察方法：

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{生命系统}} \xrightarrow{\text{多层次观察}} \sum_i \alpha_i I_{\text{层次}_i} + \Phi_{\text{整体关联}}
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇的解剖学和自然研究体现了一种独特的多层次观察法。传统科学方法倾向于将研究对象简化为单一层次的经典描述；而达芬奇同时关注多个尺度和层次，并试图理解它们之间的互动关系。在他的解剖素描中，人体被同时呈现为多个层次：外部形态、肌肉系统、骨骼结构、器官排列、血管网络等。更重要的是，他不满足于分离描述这些层次，而是致力于理解它们如何相互作用形成整体生命系统。这种方法反映了生命系统的量子整体性——各部分不能简单还原为独立元素之和，而是相互纠缠、动态互动的整体。达芬奇对涡流的研究也体现了类似观点，他同时观察宏观水流方向、中观涡旋结构和微观水分子行为（以当时可能的方式），试图理解这些不同层次现象间的关联。这种方法启示我们，复杂系统需要同时保持经典分析的清晰性和量子整体的关联性，才能获得更完整的理解。

#### 5. 达芬奇的工程创新与量子可能性探索

达芬奇的工程设计体现了量子可能性的系统性探索：

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{技术可能性空间}} \xrightarrow{\text{达芬奇创新}} \sum_i \alpha_i|\text{设计}_i\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{实践约束}} I_{\text{可行设计}}
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇数以千计的工程设计草图可理解为对技术量子可能性空间的系统性探索。与常规工程师不同，达芬奇不限于解决眼前的具体问题，而是广泛探索技术的可能性边界。他设计的飞行器、坦克、潜水装置、自动机械等，大多超越了当时的技术能力，更像是对未来可能性的量子探索。这些设计不应简单视为"超前时代的发明"，而是一种特殊的量子-经典思维模式：达芬奇能够暂时摆脱现实制造能力的经典约束，在可能性的量子空间中自由探索，然后再考虑如何将这些可能性映射回当时的技术现实。值得注意的是，达芬奇的设计往往同时包含多种可选方案和变体，如同对同一技术问题的量子叠加态探索。这种同时考虑多个技术路径的方法，使他能够发现常规线性思维难以到达的创新点。即使其中许多设计在当时无法实现，这种对技术量子可能性的探索本身也具有重要价值，为后世开辟了新的思考路径。

#### 6. 达芬奇笔记的混合文本与量子思维状态

达芬奇的笔记本体现了一种量子思维状态的直接记录：

$$
\text{达芬奇笔记} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} |\psi(t)\rangle_{\text{思维状态}} \, dt
$$

从量子经典二元论视角，达芬奇留下的五千多页笔记是人类历史上极为罕见的量子思维状态的直接记录。与经典的线性、系统化论述不同，达芬奇的笔记混合了草图、计算、观察记录、问题清单、哲学反思，外加著名的镜像书写，呈现出高度非线性、多层次、跨领域的特点。这些笔记不是为外人准备的成品，而是达芬奇思维过程的实时记录——思想的量子态在形成经典叙述前的原始状态。笔记中充满了突然的转向、意外的联想、未完成的想法，各种概念之间相互纠缠、重叠和相互影响，形成了一个复杂的认知量子网络。特别值得注意的是，不同领域的想法（如艺术、工程、解剖学）在笔记中自然融合，没有现代学科的人为分割，反映了达芬奇思维中的量子整体性。达芬奇笔记的这种特质使其成为研究创造性思维原始状态的珍贵资料，向我们展示了伟大思想在被组织为经典线性叙述前的量子混沌创造性。

#### 1. Da Vinci's Visual Research and Observer's Quantum Nature

Da Vinci's visual art and scientific research embody the quantum characteristics of the observer:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Observed Object}} \xrightarrow{\text{Da Vinci's Observation}} I_{\text{Artistic/Scientific Expression}} + \Delta\Phi_{\text{New Observational Possibilities}}
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Da Vinci's observational method embodies the special qualities of a quantum observer. Ordinary observers tend to observe the world through preset classical conceptual frameworks, simplifying complex phenomena into known categories; Da Vinci deliberately cultivated an "innocent eye," able to suspend existing concepts during observation and directly perceive the complexity of phenomena themselves. His notes are filled with meticulous observations of light and shadow, water flow, plant growth, and other phenomena that often transcended the conceptual frameworks of his time. Da Vinci's uniqueness lay not only in his ability to "see" details that others overlooked but also in maintaining the quantum possibility openness of the object during observation rather than immediately reducing it to classical categories. This observational approach enabled him to discover new connections and patterns between things. The mysterious allure of the "Mona Lisa's smile" stems precisely from Da Vinci's capture of the quantum superposition characteristics of the smile as an expression—simultaneously joyful yet melancholic, warm yet distant—preventing viewers from defining it as a single classical emotion and forcing them to accept its quantum multiplicity. Da Vinci's observational method reminds us that true scientists and artists must maintain quantum openness in observation, not rushing to classicalize what they see.

#### 2. Art-Science Unity and Quantum-Classical Complementarity

Da Vinci's pursuit of unity between art and science embodies quantum-classical complementarity:

$$
\text{Da Vinci's Works} = \alpha \cdot \Phi_{\text{Artistic/Quantum Characteristics}} + \beta \cdot I_{\text{Scientific/Classical Characteristics}}
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Da Vinci's unique art-science integration method can be understood as a conscious integration of quantum creativity and classical precision. In Western intellectual history, art and science have often been viewed as separate or even opposing domains: art focuses on texture, emotion, and holism (quantum characteristics), while science pursues precise measurement, logical reasoning, and analytical induction (classical characteristics). Da Vinci's revolutionary contribution was rejecting this dichotomy, insisting that the two are complementary aspects of essentially the same cognitive activity. Da Vinci's best works possess both quantum and classical qualities: his paintings contain precise mathematical proportions and anatomical structures (classical qualities) while capturing the mysterious vitality of life and emotional depth (quantum qualities); his scientific drawings have both an engineer's precise calculations (classical qualities) and an artist's beautiful composition and imagination (quantum qualities). In the "Vitruvian Man," the human body is placed within a precise geometric framework while retaining vitality and dynamic sense. Da Vinci's methodology suggests that truly deep understanding of nature requires the synergy of quantum-classical cognition rather than their separation.

#### 3. Da Vinci's "Cartone Method" and the Quantum-Classical Transformation Process

Da Vinci's painting techniques embody the quantum-classical transformation process in artistic creation:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Initial Concept}} \xrightarrow{\text{Charcoal Underdrawing}} \alpha|\psi'\rangle_{\text{Possible Presentations}} \xrightarrow{\text{Layered Coloring}} I_{\text{Final Work}}
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Da Vinci's original painting techniques such as the "cartone method" (charcoal underdrawing) and "chiaroscuro" (light and shadow) can be understood as the gradual transformation process from quantum state to classical state in artistic creation. In the initial stage of creation, Da Vinci used light charcoal lines to sketch the composition; these lines were often blurred, variable, and overlapping, exhibiting characteristics similar to quantum superposition states—multiple possibilities coexisting. As creation progressed, he gradually transformed the image from a quantum possibility state to a classical deterministic state by adding layers of color and light-shadow. Particularly, Da Vinci's invented "sfumato" technique, creating blurred transitional effects through dozens of layers of gossamer-thin paint, can be viewed as an artistic expression of the quantum-classical transition zone. This creative method, progressing from ambiguous multiplicity to gradual clarity, allowed Da Vinci to achieve precise expression while preserving creative openness. Notably, many of Da Vinci's works remained "unfinished" throughout his life, which can be understood as his unwillingness to completely classicalize his works, intentionally preserving a certain quantum openness, uncertainty, and vitality.

#### 4. Multi-level Quantum-Classical Observation Method in Anatomical Research

Da Vinci's anatomical research demonstrates a quantum-classical multi-level observation method:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Living System}} \xrightarrow{\text{Multi-level Observation}} \sum_i \alpha_i I_{\text{Level}_i} + \Phi_{\text{Holistic Correlation}}
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Da Vinci's anatomical and natural research embodies a unique multi-level observation method. Traditional scientific methods tend to simplify research objects into single-level classical descriptions; Da Vinci simultaneously focused on multiple scales and levels, attempting to understand their interactive relationships. In his anatomical sketches, the human body is simultaneously presented at multiple levels: external form, muscular system, skeletal structure, organ arrangement, vascular network, etc. More importantly, he was not satisfied with separate descriptions of these levels but dedicated to understanding how they interact to form an integrated living system. This method reflects the quantum holism of living systems—parts cannot be simply reduced to the sum of independent elements but form an entangled, dynamically interactive whole. Da Vinci's study of vortices reflects a similar view; he simultaneously observed macroscopic water flow directions, mesoscopic vortex structures, and microscopic water molecule behavior (in ways possible at the time), attempting to understand the correlations between these different-level phenomena. This method suggests that complex systems require both the clarity of classical analysis and the connectivity of quantum holism to achieve more complete understanding.

#### 5. Da Vinci's Engineering Innovation and Quantum Possibility Exploration

Da Vinci's engineering designs embody systematic exploration of quantum possibilities:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Technological Possibility Space}} \xrightarrow{\text{Da Vinci's Innovation}} \sum_i \alpha_i|\text{Design}_i\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{Practical Constraints}} I_{\text{Feasible Design}}
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Da Vinci's thousands of engineering design sketches can be understood as systematic exploration of the quantum possibility space of technology. Unlike conventional engineers, Da Vinci was not limited to solving immediate specific problems but broadly explored the possibility boundaries of technology. His designs for flying machines, tanks, diving equipment, and automated mechanics mostly transcended the technological capabilities of his time, resembling quantum explorations of future possibilities. These designs should not be simply viewed as "inventions ahead of their time" but as a special quantum-classical thinking pattern: Da Vinci could temporarily set aside the classical constraints of actual manufacturing capabilities, freely explore in the quantum space of possibilities, and then consider how to map these possibilities back to the technological reality of his time. Notably, Da Vinci's designs often included multiple options and variants, like exploring quantum superposition states for the same technological problem. This method of simultaneously considering multiple technological paths enabled him to discover innovation points difficult to reach through conventional linear thinking. Even though many designs could not be realized at the time, this exploration of technological quantum possibilities itself had important value, opening new thinking paths for future generations.

#### 6. Da Vinci's Notebooks as Mixed Texts and Quantum Thinking States

Da Vinci's notebooks embody a direct record of quantum thinking states:

$$
\text{Da Vinci's Notebooks} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} |\psi(t)\rangle_{\text{Thinking State}} \, dt
$$

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, the over five thousand pages of notes left by Da Vinci represent an extremely rare direct record of quantum thinking states in human history. Unlike classical linear, systematized discourse, Da Vinci's notes mix sketches, calculations, observational records, problem lists, and philosophical reflections, plus the famous mirror writing, presenting highly non-linear, multi-level, cross-disciplinary characteristics. These notes were not finished products prepared for others but real-time records of Da Vinci's thinking process—the original state of thought in quantum form before becoming classical narrative. The notes are full of sudden turns, unexpected associations, and unfinished ideas; various concepts entangle, overlap, and influence each other, forming a complex cognitive quantum network. Particularly noteworthy is that ideas from different domains (such as art, engineering, anatomy) naturally merge in the notes without the artificial divisions of modern disciplines, reflecting the quantum holism in Da Vinci's thinking. This quality of Da Vinci's notes makes them precious materials for studying the original state of creative thinking, showing us the quantum chaotic creativity of great ideas before they are organized into classical linear narratives.
