## 1. Core Concepts of Primitive Existence

### 1.1 Existence Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Existence Axiom)**

There exist most basic primitive states representing the fundamental existence of any entity:

$`\omega = \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$

Where:
- $`\omega_0`$ is primitive void, representing the state of non-existence
- $`\omega_1`$ is primitive existence, representing the state of existence

**Axiom 2 (Existence Uniqueness Axiom)**

The existence state of any entity is well-defined:

$`\forall x, \exists! s \in \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}: \Omega(x) = s`$

Where $`\Omega`$ is the existence function mapping any object to its existence state.

### 1.2 Nature of Existence State

Existence state is the most fundamental property in the universe, defined through the existence measure function $`\Phi`$:

$`\Phi(\omega_0) = 0`$ (Existence measure of primitive void is zero)
$`\Phi(\omega_1) = 1`$ (Existence measure of primitive existence is one)

The existence measure exhibits the most fundamental binary nature:

$`\Phi(s) \in \{0, 1\}`$

This binary nature forms the foundation of all higher-dimensional theories.

### 1.3 Primitive State Transformation

The basic transformation between existence states is defined as the FLIP operation:

$`\text{FLIP}: \{\omega_0, \omega_1\} \rightarrow \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$

FLIP operation can be represented as primitive XOR with $`\omega_1`$:

$`\text{FLIP}(\omega) = \omega \otimes \omega_1`$

Where $`\otimes`$ represents the primitive XOR operation, specifically implemented as:

$`\text{FLIP}(\omega_0) = \omega_0 \otimes \omega_1 = \omega_1`$
$`\text{FLIP}(\omega_1) = \omega_1 \otimes \omega_1 = \omega_0`$

The FLIP operation is the prototype of all state transformations, extending to SHIFT operation in higher-dimensional theories.

## 2. Transformations and Relations of Primitive Existence

### 2.1 Transformation Between Existence and Void

The transformation between existence and void constitutes the most fundamental dynamics of the universe:

$`\omega_0 \xrightarrow{\text{FLIP}} \omega_1`$ (From void to existence)
$`\omega_1 \xrightarrow{\text{FLIP}} \omega_0`$ (From existence to void)

This transformation can be expressed as primitive XOR operation:

$`\text{FLIP}(\omega) = \omega \otimes \omega_1`$

This gives the FLIP operation its basic periodicity:

$`\text{FLIP}^2(\omega) = \text{FLIP}(\text{FLIP}(\omega)) = \text{FLIP}(\omega \otimes \omega_1) = (\omega \otimes \omega_1) \otimes \omega_1 = \omega \otimes (\omega_1 \otimes \omega_1) = \omega \otimes \omega_0 = \omega`$

Indicating that a double transformation of an existence state returns to the original state.

### 2.2 Self-Referentiality of Existence State

Existence states possess self-referential properties, expressed as self-application of the existence function:

$`\Omega(\Omega(s)) = \Omega(s)`$

This indicates that self-reference of existence property does not change its existence state, forming the basis of the self-stability of existence.

## 3. Extensibility of Primitive Existence

### 3.1 Basic Properties of Existence

Existence states have three basic properties:

1. **Binary Nature**: $`\forall s, s \in \{\omega_0, \omega_1\}`$
2. **Determinism**: $`\Omega(s) = s`$
3. **Transformability**: $`\forall s, \exists \text{FLIP}: \text{FLIP}(s) \neq s`$

These three properties form the descriptive framework at the most basic level of the universe.

### 3.2 Extension to Multiple States

Primitive existence extends to multiple states through combination:

$`\Omega^2 = \{\omega_0\omega_0, \omega_0\omega_1, \omega_1\omega_0, \omega_1\omega_1\}`$

This extension establishes the basic pathway from single existence states to binary existence states:

$`\Phi(\omega_i\omega_j) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } \Phi(\omega_i) = \Phi(\omega_j) = 0 \\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}`$

This extension mechanism lays the necessary foundation for the Fundamental Element Theory.

## 4. Theory Reference Relationships

### 4.1 Relationship with Higher Dimensional Theories

The relationship between Primitive Existence Theory and higher-dimensional theories:

$`T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \subset T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} \subset T_{\text{Unit Paradigm}} \subset T_{\text{Dual Element}} \subset T_{\text{Fundamental System}} \subset T_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}}`$

Dimensional relationships:

$`D_{\text{Primitive Existence}} = 1 < D_{\text{Fundamental Element}} = 2 < D_{\text{Unit Paradigm}} = 5 < D_{\text{Dual Element}} = 7 < D_{\text{Fundamental System}} = 8 < D_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}} = 10`$

Primitive Existence Theory provides the existential foundation for Fundamental Element Theory:

$`T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} = T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \oplus \text{FLIP}(T_{\text{Primitive Existence}})`$

### 4.2 Theory Dependency Structure

Primitive Existence Theory sits at the bottom layer of the theory spectrum, forming the absolute starting point of the theory dependency chain:

$`T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \xrightarrow{\text{FLIP}} T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Unit Paradigm}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Dual Element}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Fundamental System}} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}} T_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}}`$

The FLIP operation from Primitive Existence Theory extends into XOR and SHIFT operations in Fundamental Element Theory:

$`\text{FLIP}(\omega_i) \mapsto \varepsilon_i \oplus \varepsilon_1 = \text{SHIFT}(\varepsilon_i)`$

This establishes a natural connection between Primitive Existence Theory and Fundamental Element Theory:

$`T_{\text{Fundamental Element}} = T_{\text{Primitive Existence}} \oplus \text{FLIP}(T_{\text{Primitive Existence}})`$

Primitive Existence Theory is the lowest-dimensional theory, providing the most basic concepts of existence and state transformation mechanisms for the entire theoretical system, forming the ultimate foundation of the theoretical spectrum from the simplest existence concepts to complex cosmic ontology.

This theory, as the bottom layer of the entire cosmic ontological theoretical system, provides the source description of all existence.
