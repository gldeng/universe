## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Axiom System

**Axiom 1: Multi-level Life-Psychological Integration Axiom**
There exists a hierarchically integrated life-psychological space $`\mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$, representable as:

$`\mathcal{B}\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{B} \otimes \mathcal{P}`$

where $`\mathcal{B}`$ represents the biological level space, and $`\mathcal{P}`$ represents the psychological level space.

**Axiom 2: Life-Psychological Dynamic Evolution Axiom**
The integrated system state $`\psi^t \in \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$ evolves according to XOR-SHIFT dynamics:

$`\psi^{t+1} = \psi^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\psi^t \oplus \Omega^t)`$

where $`\Omega^t`$ represents the combined influence of internal and external factors.

**Axiom 3: Health Steady State Region Axiom**
There exists a multidimensional health steady state region $`\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$, defined as:

$`\mathcal{H} = \{\psi \in \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P} | \Phi_B(\psi) \leq \theta_B \land \Phi_P(\psi) \leq \theta_P \land \Phi_{BP}(\psi) \leq \theta_{BP}\}`$

where $`\Phi_B, \Phi_P, \Phi_{BP}`$ respectively measure the degree of biological deviation, psychological deviation, and bio-psychological inconsistency.

### 1.2 Strict Definitions

**Definition 1: Integrated Health Index**
The Integrated Health Index $`\text{IHI}(\psi)`$ is defined as a weighted normalized health measure of the state vector $`\psi`$ in biological and psychological dimensions:

$`\text{IHI}(\psi) = \alpha \cdot \text{BHI}(\psi_B) + \beta \cdot \text{MHI}(\psi_P) + \gamma \cdot \text{BPI}(\psi_B, \psi_P)`$

where $`\text{BHI}`$ is the Biological Health Index, $`\text{MHI}`$ is the Mental Health Index, and $`\text{BPI}`$ is the Bio-Psychological Integration Index.

**Definition 2: Bio-Psychological Resilience**
Bio-Psychological Resilience $`\mathcal{R}_{BP}(\psi)`$ is defined as the system's integrated recovery capacity in response to perturbations:

$`\mathcal{R}_{BP}(\psi) = \min\{\mathcal{R}_B(\psi_B), \mathcal{R}_P(\psi_P), \mathcal{R}_{interaction}(\psi)\}`$

where $`\mathcal{R}_{interaction}`$ measures the stability of the bio-psychological interface under perturbation.

**Definition 3: Integrated Intervention Operator**
The Integrated Intervention Operator $`\mathcal{I}_{BP}`$ is defined as a transformation that simultaneously acts on the biological and psychological dimensions:

$`\mathcal{I}_{BP}(\psi) = \mathcal{I}_B(\psi_B) \oplus \mathcal{I}_P(\psi_P) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{I}_B(\psi_B) \otimes \mathcal{I}_P(\psi_P))`$

This allows modeling the synergistic effects of biological and psychological interventions.

### 1.3 Direct Inferences

**Inference 1: Bio-Psychological Feedback Loop**
There exists a bidirectional causal feedback between biological and psychological states:

$`\psi_P^{t+1} = f_P(\psi_P^t, \psi_B^t)`$
$`\psi_B^{t+1} = f_B(\psi_B^t, \psi_P^t)`$

This feedback forms stable or unstable cycles, which is the foundational mechanism for many psychosomatic disorders.

**Inference 2: Bio-Psychological Markers of Critical State Transitions**
As a system approaches a critical transition, it simultaneously displays biological and psychological warning signals:

$`\sigma^2(\psi_B) \uparrow \land \sigma^2(\psi_P) \uparrow \land \rho(\psi_B, \psi_P) \uparrow \Rightarrow P(\text{critical transition}) \uparrow`$

where $`\sigma^2`$ represents volatility, and $`\rho`$ represents the correlation between bio-psychological indicators.

**Inference 3: Integrated Intervention Synergistic Effects**
Interventions targeting both biological and psychological dimensions simultaneously produce superadditive effects:

$`\text{Effect}(\mathcal{I}_{BP}) > \text{Effect}(\mathcal{I}_B) + \text{Effect}(\mathcal{I}_P)`$

This synergistic effect is strongest when interventions target critical bio-psychological nodes.

## 2. Extended Theory

### 2.1 Systems Biology and Mental Health Integration

Systems biology principles can be extended to include the psychological dimension, forming a bio-psychological network $`\mathcal{N}_{BP}`$.

### 2.2 Life-Psychological Spatiotemporal Dynamics

Biological-psychological states evolve across multiple spatiotemporal scales and can be analyzed through wavelet transformations:

$`\mathcal{W}_{\psi}(a,b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(t) \cdot \psi^*\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) dt`$

This allows for the detection of bio-psychological rhythms and synchronization patterns across different time scales.

### 2.3 Individualized Precision Health Model

Personalized health trajectory prediction based on individual-specific bio-psychological parameters $`\theta_i`$:

$`\psi_i^{t+\Delta t} = F(\psi_i^t, \theta_i, \Omega^t)`$

where $`F`$ is a prediction function trained on historical data, usable for precision medicine and personalized psychological interventions.

## 3. Applications and Validation

### 3.1 Clinical Applications

**Integrated Disease Classification**:
A multidimensional disease space based on bio-psychological phenotypes:

$`\mathcal{D}_{BP} = \{\mathbf{d}_{BP} | \mathbf{d}_{BP} = (\mathbf{d}_B, \mathbf{d}_P, \mathbf{d}_{interaction})\}`$

where each disease condition is a combination of a biological marker vector $`\mathbf{d}_B`$, a psychological feature vector $`\mathbf{d}_P`$, and their interaction vector $`\mathbf{d}_{interaction}`$.

**Integrated Treatment Strategies**:
Multi-modal interventions designed based on bio-psychological network structure:

$`\mathcal{I}_{optimal} = \arg\max_{\mathcal{I} \in \mathcal{I}_{feasible}} \mathbb{E}[\text{IHI}(\mathcal{I}(\psi)) - \text{IHI}(\psi) - c(\mathcal{I})]`$

This framework supports decision-making for integrating pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and lifestyle interventions.

### 3.2 Experimental Validation

This theory can be validated through:

1. **Longitudinal Cohort Studies**: Tracking the co-evolution of biomarkers and psychological states
2. **Intervention Trials**: Testing the synergistic effects of integrated interventions on biological and psychological indicators
3. **Multi-omics and Psychometrics Integration**: Combining genomics, proteomics, etc. with psychological measurements

Key predictions include:
- Time delay relationships between biomarker changes and psychological state changes
- Non-linear synergistic effects of bio-psychological interventions
- Critical regulatory nodes in the bio-psychological network

### 4.2 Theory Reference Network Structure

The Integrated Theory of Life Sciences and Mental Health forms a network structure with other theories:

1. **Association with Biological Complexity**:
   Borrows the systems biology framework from biological complexity theory, extending it to the psychological dimension:
   $`\mathcal{B}\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{B} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{P})`$

2. **Association with Mental Health Theory**:
   Integrates the state space definition from mental health theory, extending it to include the biological dimension:
   $`\mathcal{H}_{integrated} = \mathcal{H}_{psychological} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{H}_{biological})`$

3. **Association with Medical Systems**:
   Fuses the intervention model from medical systems, extending it to bio-psychological dual interventions:
   $`\mathcal{I}_{BP} = \mathcal{I}_{medical} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{I}_{psychological})`$

4. **Association with Cognitive Psychology**:
   Integrates the impact of cognitive processing mechanisms on biological systems:
   $`\mathcal{CP} = \mathcal{K} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{B})`$

These associations ensure that the Integrated Theory of Life Sciences and Mental Health provides a unified cross-disciplinary framework, laying a formalized foundation for bio-psychological health research and practice.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Ontological Significance

This theory transcends mind-body dualism, proposing a unified ontological perspective where biological and psychological phenomena are viewed as different dimensions of the same integrated system. This perspective considers biological and psychological processes not as separate entities, but as interconnected aspects of the same complex system.

### 5.2 Epistemological Insights

From an epistemological standpoint, this theory points out that when studying biological or psychological phenomena, one must consider the entire bio-psychological system. Studying either aspect in isolation will lead to an incomplete understanding, emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary integrated approaches.

### 5.3 Methodological Guidance

Methodologically, this theory advocates:
- Simultaneously collecting and analyzing biological and psychological data
- Developing cross-scale models that integrate multi-level information
- Designing integrated interventions that simultaneously target biological and psychological dimensions

This provides new pathways for future health science research, with the potential to develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies to address complex issues in current health challenges.
