## 1. Ontological Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Absolute Recursive Origin Axiom)**

The ultimate nature of the universe is an absolute recursive self-referential structure, which is both its own origin and its own purpose:

$`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is a super-recursive function satisfying $`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{F}`$.

---

**Axiom 2 (Binary-Unitary Axiom)**

The universe simultaneously manifests as duality and unity, forming a dual mode of existence through XOR super-recursion:

$`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C = \mathcal{U} \oplus \mathcal{U}`$

where $`\Omega_Q`$ is the quantum domain, $`\Omega_C`$ is the classical domain, and $`\oplus`$ is the super-XOR operation.

---

**Axiom 3 (Information Ontology Axiom)**

The fundamental entity of the universe is information, and all its physical, psychological, and metaphysical attributes are different expressions of information:

$`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$

where $`I(x)`$ is the information expression function of entity $`x`$.

---

**Axiom 4 (Multiple Dimension Axiom)**

Universe dimensions form an infinitely recursive self-organizing spectrum, extending continuously from $`D_0`$ to $`D_\infty`$:

$`\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} D_i, \quad D_{i+1} = \mathcal{R}(D_i)`$

where $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the dimensional recursive generation function.

---

**Axiom 5 (Transfinite Synthesis Axiom)**

Any binary opposition is unified as a whole in higher-dimensional space, realized through the transfinite synthesis function $`\mathcal{S}`$:

$`\mathcal{S}(A, \neg A) = \{A, \neg A, A \cap \neg A, A \cup \neg A, \complement(A \cup \neg A), \mathcal{S}\}`$

The transfinite synthesis function $`\mathcal{S}`$ includes itself in its result, embodying absolute self-reference.

## 2. Binary-Unitary Structure

### 2.1 Super-XOR Model of Binary-Unitary Structure

The binary-unitary structure of the universe is expressed through super-XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{U}_{t+1} = \mathcal{U}_t \oplus \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}_t)`$

where the super-XOR operation $`\oplus`$ simultaneously possesses the separative nature of duality and the unifying nature of unity:

$`a \oplus b = \begin{cases}
  a \oplus_B b & \text{in binary perspective} \\
  \mathcal{S}(a, b) & \text{in unitary perspective}
\end{cases}`$

Here $`\oplus_B`$ is the traditional binary XOR, while $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the transfinite synthesis function.

---

### 2.2 Unification of Binary and Ontological Expressions

There exists a precise mapping between the binary expression and the ontological expression of the universe:

$`\Phi: \mathcal{U}_{\text{binary}} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_{\text{ontological}}`$

satisfying:

$`\Phi(\mathcal{U}_{\text{binary}} \oplus_B \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}_{\text{binary}})) = \Phi(\mathcal{U}_{\text{binary}}) \oplus_M \mathcal{F}(\Phi(\mathcal{U}_{\text{binary}}))`$

where $`\oplus_M`$ is the meta-operation on the ontological domain.

---

### 2.3 Binary-Unitary Phase Transition Theory

There exists a phase transition interface $`\mathcal{I}_{D-M}`$ between binary and unitary perspectives:

$`\mathcal{I}_{D-M} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \Theta(x) = \Theta_c\}`$

where $`\Theta`$ is the consciousness integration measure. When $`\Theta(x) > \Theta_c`$, the system exhibits a unitary perspective; when $`\Theta(x) < \Theta_c`$, the system exhibits a binary perspective.

The binary-unitary phase transition follows supercritical dynamics:

$`\frac{d\Theta}{dt} = \alpha\nabla^2\Theta + \beta(\Theta-\Theta_c)(\Theta_c-\Theta+\mu) + \gamma\xi(t)`$

where $`\xi(t)`$ is the quantum fluctuation term and $`\mu`$ is the unity bias parameter.

## 3. Recursive Evolution Dynamics

### 3.1 Super-Recursive Evolution Equation

The universe evolves according to super-recursive dynamics:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{U}}{dt} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{U} \oplus \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}))`$

where $`\mathcal{L}`$ is the super-Laplacian operator with self-correcting properties:

$`\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_0 + \mathcal{L}_1(\mathcal{U}) + \mathcal{L}_2(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}))`$

This indicates that the cosmic laws themselves are evolving, forming super-self-covariance.

---

### 3.2 Recursive Depth and Universe Age

The history of the universe is essentially the depth of recursive iterations:

$`\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{U}) = \log_{\mathcal{R}}(N)`$

where $`N`$ is the number of iterations and $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the recursive base.

The relationship between recursive depth and time is non-linear:

$`t = t_0 \cdot e^{\lambda \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{U})}`$

As the recursive depth approaches infinity, the universe reaches a transfinite recursive state:

$`\lim_{N \to \infty} \mathcal{U}_N = \mathcal{U}_{\infty} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}_{\infty})`$

---

### 3.3 Recursive Fixed Points and Universe Topology

The topology of the universe is determined by super-recursive fixed points:

$`\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{U}) = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{F}(x) = x\}`$

The density of fixed points is proportional to topological complexity:

$`C_{\mathcal{T}} = \int_{\mathcal{U}} \delta(\mathcal{F}(x) - x) dx`$

The connections between fixed points form the universal network structure:

$`G_{\mathcal{U}} = (V_{\mathcal{T}}, E_{\mathcal{T}}), \quad E_{\mathcal{T}} = \{(x,y) | d_{\mathcal{F}}(x,y) < \epsilon\}`$

where $`d_{\mathcal{F}}`$ is the super-recursive metric.

## 4. Dimensional Spectrum Theory

### 4.1 Dimensional Generation Recursive Equation

The dimensional spectrum is generated through a recursive equation:

$`D_{n+1} = \mathcal{R}(D_n) = D_n \cup \{\mathcal{O}(D_n)\}`$

where $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the observation function that maps a dimension to its meta-dimension.

The set of all dimensions forms a complete spectrum:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{D_0, D_1, D_2, ..., D_{43}, D_{44}, ..., D_{\infty}\}`$

Dimensions have a partial order relationship:

$`D_i \preceq D_j \iff \exists \phi_{i,j}: D_i \rightarrow D_j`$

where $`\phi_{i,j}`$ is the dimensional embedding mapping.

---

### 4.2 Information Mechanism of Dimensional Emergence

Dimensional emergence is the result of information integration:

$`D(x) = \log \Phi(x)`$

where $`\Phi(x)`$ is the information integration measure:

$`\Phi(x) = \sum_{i,j} \frac{I_{\text{mutual}}(x_i;x_j|x_{i,j}^c)}{H(x_i|x_{i}^c) + H(x_j|x_{j}^c)}`$

Higher-dimensional structures have stronger information integration, manifested as a precise balance between information redundancy and mutual information:

$`R(D_n) - I_{\text{mutual}}(D_n) = \text{constant} \cdot e^{-\alpha n}`$

---

### 4.3 Transfinite Dimensional Set and Absolute Dimension

As the dimensional index approaches infinity, the dimensional spectrum converges to a transfinite dimension:

$`D_{\infty} = \lim_{n \to \infty} D_n = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} D_i`$

The absolute dimension $`D_{\mathcal{A}}`$ not only contains all dimensions but also all possible ways of constructing dimensions:

$`D_{\mathcal{A}} = \{D_{\infty}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{O}, D_{\mathcal{A}}\}`$

The absolute dimension has complete self-reference:

$`D_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathcal{F}(D_{\mathcal{A}})`$

## 5. Information Ontology

### 5.1 Ontological Status of Information

Information is essentially the fundamental mode of existence of the universe:

$`\mathcal{I} = \{I_Q, I_C, I_M, I_{\mathcal{A}}\}`$

where:
- $`I_Q`$: Quantum information (possibility information)
- $`I_C`$: Classical information (deterministic information)
- $`I_M`$: Meta-information (information about information)
- $`I_{\mathcal{A}}`$: Absolute information (self-referential information)

There are conversion relationships between these types of information:

$`\mathcal{T}_{QC}: I_Q \rightarrow I_C \oplus I_H`$
$`\mathcal{T}_{CM}: I_C \rightarrow I_M \oplus I_L`$
$`\mathcal{T}_{MA}: I_M \rightarrow I_{\mathcal{A}} \oplus I_{\emptyset}`$

where $`I_H, I_L, I_{\emptyset}`$ are hidden information, lost information, and void information, respectively.

---

### 5.2 Super-Principle of Information Conservation

Extended law of information conservation:

$`I_{\text{total}}(\mathcal{U}) = I_Q + I_C + I_M + I_{\mathcal{A}} + I_H + I_L + I_{\emptyset} = \text{constant}`$

Information transforms between different forms, but the total amount remains unchanged:

$`\frac{dI_{\text{total}}}{dt} = 0`$

An increase in one form of information necessarily leads to a decrease in other forms:

$`\frac{dI_Q}{dt} + \frac{dI_C}{dt} + \frac{dI_M}{dt} + \frac{dI_{\mathcal{A}}}{dt} + \frac{dI_H}{dt} + \frac{dI_L}{dt} + \frac{dI_{\emptyset}}{dt} = 0`$

---

### 5.3 Information Entropy and Information Phase Space

Information exists in a multidimensional phase space:

$`\Gamma_I = \{(I_Q, I_C, I_M, I_{\mathcal{A}}, S_Q, S_C, S_M, S_{\mathcal{A}})\}`$

where $`S_X`$ is the entropy of the corresponding information type.

There is an uncertainty relationship between information entropy and information quantity:

$`\Delta I_X \cdot \Delta S_X \geq \frac{1}{2}\ln(D_X)`$

where $`D_X`$ is the dimension of the corresponding information type.

Information systems spontaneously evolve according to the principle of least action:

$`\delta \int \mathcal{L}_I(I, \dot{I}, \nabla I) dt = 0`$

where $`\mathcal{L}_I`$ is the information Lagrangian.

## 6. Observers and Meta-Observers

### 6.1 Super-Recursive Structure of Observers

An observer is essentially a self-referential sub-structure of the universe:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{O}}\}`$

where the newly added $`\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{O}}`$ is the observer's recursive self-reference function:

$`\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{O}}: \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}`$

Observers achieve self-cognition through recursive self-reference:

$`\mathcal{O}_{t+1} = \mathcal{O}_t \oplus \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathcal{O}_t)`$

This process forms the cognitive closed loop of the observer:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\infty} = \lim_{t \to \infty} \mathcal{O}_t = \mathcal{O}_{\infty} \oplus \mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathcal{O}_{\infty})`$

---

### 6.2 Meta-Observers and Observer Networks

A meta-observer is a higher-dimensional structure that observes observers:

$`\mathcal{O}^{(2)} = \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{O}^{(1)})`$

forming a recursive sequence:

$`\mathcal{O}^{(n+1)} = \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{O}^{(n)})`$

Observer networks form a multi-level structure:

$`\mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{O}} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{O}}\}`$

The collective consciousness of the network is an emergent phenomenon:

$`\Psi_{\mathcal{N}} = \mathcal{F}[\{\Psi_{\mathcal{O}_i}\}] \neq \sum_i \Psi_{\mathcal{O}_i}`$

---

### 6.3 Super-Observer and Absolute Perspective

The super-observer $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{A}}`$ transcends all finite observers:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{A}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{O}^{(n)} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \mathcal{O}^{(i)}`$

The super-observer has complete self-referential capability:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{A}} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{A}})`$

The absolute perspective simultaneously contains all relative perspectives and itself:

$`V_{\mathcal{A}} = \{V_1, V_2, ..., V_n, ..., V_{\mathcal{A}}\}`$

This structure solves the problem of infinite regression by achieving closure through self-containment.

## 7. Transfinite Synthesis of Cosmic Essence

### 7.1 Universe Existence Equation

The ultimate equation of universe existence:

$`\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{U}) = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}) \oplus \mathcal{U}`$

where $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the existence operator and $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the super-recursive function.

The necessary condition for existence is self-verification:

$`\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{U}) = 1 \iff \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$

This indicates that the universe verifies its own existence through self-reference.

---

### 7.2 Transfinite Synthesis of Cosmic Meaning

The overall meaning of the universe is given by the transfinite synthesis function:

$`\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{U}) = \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{U}, \neg\mathcal{U})`$

expanded as:

$`\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{U}) = \{\mathcal{U}, \neg\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{U} \cap \neg\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{U} \cup \neg\mathcal{U}, \complement(\mathcal{U} \cup \neg\mathcal{U}), \mathcal{S}\}`$

Meaning itself is contained in the set of meaning, forming a recursive closure.

The universe simultaneously has meaning and no meaning:

$`\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{U}) = \mathcal{U} \oplus \mathcal{U} = 0 \land \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{U}) \neq 0`$

---

### 7.3 Absolute Recursive Expression of Ontological Origin

The ontological nature of the universe is manifested as absolute recursive self-generation:

$`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{U})`$

where $`\mathcal{G}`$ is the self-generation function.

Ontological generation has a three-level structure:

$`\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}_1 \circ \mathcal{G}_2 \circ \mathcal{G}_3`$

where:
- $`\mathcal{G}_1`$: Generation of existence
- $`\mathcal{G}_2`$: Generation of structure
- $`\mathcal{G}_3`$: Generation of meaning

The generation sequence extends infinitely:

$`\mathcal{U}_0 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{U}_1 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{U}_2 \xrightarrow{\mathcal{G}} ... \xrightarrow{\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{U}_{\infty}`$

$`\mathcal{U}_{\infty} = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{U}_{\infty})`$

## 8. Conclusion

Cosmic Ontology provides an ultimate theoretical framework that transcends binary opposition:

1. The essence of the universe is an absolute recursive self-referential structure, which is both binary and unitary.

2. Information is the fundamental mode of existence of the universe, existing in the forms of quantum, classical, meta-information, and absolute information.

3. Dimensions form an infinite spectrum, extending from $`D_0`$ to $`D_{\infty}`$, forming a recursively nested structure.

4. The observer network is a multi-level structure of the universe observing itself, with the super-observer as its limit.

5. The existence, meaning, and origin of the universe are self-verified through transfinite synthesis and absolute recursion.

Cosmic Ontology unifies Binary Cosmology and Quantum Classical Dualism, providing a complete description of the essential nature of universal existence, answering not only "how the universe exists" but also the fundamental question of "why the universe exists."
