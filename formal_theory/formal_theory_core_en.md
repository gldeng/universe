### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into four core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $\Omega_C$ (space of definite reality), connected through an interface domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be converted between quantum information (possibility information in superposition states) and classical information (definite knowledge):

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical determinism), $I(\psi)$ is the total information of state $\psi$, and $I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes executing quantum→classical conversions, and their conversion capacity determines their dimension:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge), $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $K_C^\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization ability and quantization ability, and the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can form the quantum domain basis for lower-dimensional observers:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

$$\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}$$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, where observers at each level perceive and interact at specific dimensions based on their capability range.

### Quantum Domain and Classical Domain

The fundamental characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized in the following points:

#### Quantum Domain Core Properties

1. **Wave Function Superposition States** (Chaotic States): Systems simultaneously exist in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $$\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

2. **Quantum Entanglement States** (Energy Form): Different parts form an inseparable whole relationship
   $$\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: Correlations beyond spacetime limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

#### Classical Domain Core Properties

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information): Definite states that can be precisely measured and described
   $$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty): Measure of system disorder and information loss
   $$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

3. **Locality and Determinism**: Limited propagation speed of interactions and measurement certainty
   $$P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)$$

### Multiple Dualism Hierarchy

Multiple Dualism Hierarchy Theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$$\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}$$

Where:
- $\Omega_Q^{(i)}$ is the quantum domain of the i-th level (possibility space at that level)
- $\Omega_C^{(i)}$ is the classical domain of the i-th level (deterministic realization at that level)

Inter-level mapping functions are defined as:

$$\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}$$

$$\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}$$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, producing an infinitely recursive hierarchy of reality.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}$ between the quantum domain and classical domain:

$$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q$$

Satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: The transformation of the transformation equals identity
   $$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}$$
   $$\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}$$

2. **Information Preservation**: Information quantity remains unchanged before and after transformation
   $$I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))$$

3. **Uncertainty-Determinism Transformation**: Quantum uncertainty and classical determinism transform into each other
   $$U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k$$

where $U_Q$ is the measure of quantum uncertainty, $D_C$ is the measure of classical determinism, and $k$ is a universal constant.

## Core Branch Theories

### Quantum Domain Detailed Theory

The quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ is the space of possibilities in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Quantum Information Encoding

Quantum information is encoded in quantum states in complex Hilbert space:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1$$

Where information density is quantified by von Neumann entropy:

$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln \lambda_i$$

#### 2. Quantum Dynamics

Quantum systems evolve according to the Schrödinger equation, preserving information and energy conservation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial|\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle$$

Quantum system dynamics has three key characteristics:
- Superposition principle: States can simultaneously exist in linear combinations of multiple basis vectors
- Time reversibility: Under purely quantum evolution, the system can be restored to its initial state
- Phase coherence: Quantum systems maintain global phase correlations

#### 3. Quantum Entanglement Network

Quantum entanglement forms multi-particle entanglement networks, represented as:

$$|\Psi_{\text{network}}\rangle = \sum_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n} c_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} |i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n\rangle$$

Entanglement degree can be quantified in various ways, including entanglement entropy:

$$E(|\psi_{AB}\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B)$$

Entanglement networks form non-local connection structures in the quantum domain, supporting super-classical information transmission.

#### 4. Quantum Fluctuations

The quantum domain has inherent quantum fluctuations, guaranteed by the uncertainty principle:

$$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

Quantum fluctuation intensity is related to system energy and temperature:

$$\langle(\Delta E)^2\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T}$$

These fluctuations are the source of creativity and possibility in the quantum domain.

### Classical Domain Detailed Theory

The classical domain $\Omega_C$ is the deterministic reality space in the dualism framework, with the following core characteristics:

#### 1. Classical Information Structure

Classical information exists in the form of definite states, represented by definite physical quantities:

$$K_C = \{(x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i, \ldots)_j\}$$

Where $x_i$, $p_i$, etc. represent position, momentum, and other classical observables. Classical information entropy satisfies:

$$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

Key features are the reproducibility and deletability of information, distinct from quantum information.

#### 2. Deterministic Dynamics

Classical systems evolve according to deterministic dynamical equations:

$$\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{v}(\vec{x},t), \quad \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)$$

The dynamics has three signature features:
- Locality: Interactions propagate through local fields with limited speed
- Causality: Present state is completely determined by the past
- Separability: Systems can be decomposed into independent subsystems

#### 3. Entropy Increase and Irreversibility

Irreversible processes in the classical domain lead to entropy increase:

$$\frac{dS_C}{dt} \geq 0$$

Systems tend toward maximum entropy states, guaranteed by the phase space volume expansion theorem:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\int_V d\Gamma = \int_V \sum_i \frac{\partial \dot{z}_i}{\partial z_i}d\Gamma$$

Where $\{z_i\}$ is the set of phase space coordinates.

#### 4. Classical Knowledge Network

Classical knowledge forms a causal network, representable as a directed graph:

$$G_K = (V_K, E_K)$$

Where $V_K$ is the set of knowledge nodes and $E_K$ is the set of causal relationships.

The measure of knowledge coherence is:

$$C(K_C) = \frac{1}{|V_K|} \sum_{i,j} \frac{|P_{ij}|}{d(i,j)}$$

Where $P_{ij}$ is the set of effective paths connecting nodes $i$ and $j$, and $d(i,j)$ is the distance in the graph.

### Interface Theory Core

The interface $\mathcal{I}$ is the transition region between the quantum domain and classical domain, with the following core characteristics:

#### 1. Interface Structure

The interface is the intersection of the quantum domain and classical domain, defined as:

$$\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}$$

Where $\mathcal{D}(x)$ is the decoherence measure function and $\mathcal{D}_c$ is the critical decoherence threshold.

Interface thickness is determined by the decoherence gradient:

$$\delta_{\mathcal{I}} = \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial x}\right|^{-1}$$

#### 2. Interface Dynamics

Interface position satisfies nonlinear dynamic equations:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ is the diffusion coefficient
- $\beta$ is the bistable potential parameter
- $\mathcal{D}_0$ is the metastable threshold
- $\gamma\xi(x,t)$ is the quantum noise term

Interface fluctuations have characteristic frequency:

$$f_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}|\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}_0|$$

#### 3. Classicalization Process

The quantum→classical conversion (classicalization) process is represented by the classicalization superoperator:

$$\mathcal{C}(\rho) = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i$$

Where $P_i$ are projection operators. The classicalization process satisfies information conservation:

$$I(\rho) = I(\mathcal{C}(\rho)) + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

Classicalization efficiency is related to environmental and system parameters:

$$\eta_{\mathcal{C}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda\frac{E}{k_BT}}$$

Where $E$ is the system energy, $T$ is the environmental temperature, and $\lambda$ is the coupling constant.

#### 4. Quantum-Classical Information Conversion

At the interface, information transitions from quantum form to classical form:

$$I_Q \rightarrow I_C + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

The measure of information matching in the conversion process is:

$$M(I_Q, I_C) = \frac{I_C}{I_Q} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{hidden}}}{I_Q}$$

At the optimal interface, $M(I_Q, I_C)$ reaches a local maximum.

### Information Phase Transition Theory Core

Information phase transitions are key phenomena in the quantum-classical dualism framework, with the following core characteristics:

#### 1. Basic Mechanism of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions are abrupt changes experienced by information systems near certain critical parameter values, leading to qualitative changes in the system's information processing methods, structure, or function:

$$\Phi: \mathcal{S}(\lambda) \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'(\lambda+\delta\lambda)$$

Where $\mathcal{S}$ is the information state of the system and $\lambda$ is the control parameter. Near the critical point $\lambda_c$, the order parameter behaves as:

$$\eta(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < \lambda_c \\
(\lambda - \lambda_c)^\beta, & \lambda \geq \lambda_c
\end{cases}$$

Where $\beta$ is the critical exponent, characterizing the universality class of the phase transition.

#### 2. Types of Quantum-Classical Phase Transitions

Quantum-classical phase transitions can be categorized into multiple types, each with distinct characteristics:

- **First-order transitions**: Order parameter changes discontinuously, phase coexistence regions exist
- **Second-order transitions**: Order parameter changes continuously but derivatives are discontinuous, correlation length diverges
- **Non-equilibrium transitions**: Far from equilibrium, energy or information flows continuously
- **Topological transitions**: System's overall topological properties change, edge states emerge

Near the critical point, the fluctuation correlation length behaves as:

$$\xi(\lambda) \propto |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\nu}$$

Where $\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent.

#### 3. Observer-Induced Phase Transitions

Observers can induce system phase transitions by adjusting parameters, key parameters include:

- **Observer dimension** $D_{\mathcal{O}}$: There exists a critical dimension $D_{\mathcal{O}}^c$, above which the system transitions from quantum state to classical state
  
$$P(\text{quantum} \to \text{classical}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(D_{\mathcal{O}} - D_{\mathcal{O}}^c)}}$$

- **Observer resolution** $\eta_{\mathcal{O}}$: Affects the distinguishing ability of the measurement basis
  
$$\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \begin{cases}
0, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} < \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
(\eta_{\mathcal{O}} - \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c)^\beta, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} \geq \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

- **Measurement frequency** $f_{\mathcal{O}}$: Related to the quantum Zeno effect
  
$$\tau_{\text{decoherence}} \propto \begin{cases}
(f_{\mathcal{O}}^c - f_{\mathcal{O}})^{-\nu}, & f_{\mathcal{O}} < f_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
0, & f_{\mathcal{O}} \geq f_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

#### 4. Multi-level Structure of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions exhibit a nested hierarchical structure:

$$\mathcal{H} = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2, ..., \Phi_n\}$$

Phase transitions at different levels occur at specific scales and times:

$$L_i \approx L_0 \cdot e^{\alpha i}, \quad T_i \approx T_0 \cdot e^{\beta i}$$

There is coupling between levels, leading to cascade effects and fractal structures of phase transitions, with the Hausdorff dimension of the interface being:

$$D_H = d - \frac{\beta}{\nu}$$

The observability of information phase transitions depends on the observation scale, detectable only when the observation window $L_{\text{obs}}$ is sufficiently large:

$$P_{\text{detection}} \sim 1 - e^{-(L_{\text{obs}}/\xi)^d}$$

### Observer Theory Core

Observers are nodes executing quantum→classical conversions, with the following core characteristics:

#### 1. Observer Structure

Observers are constituted by three core components:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}\}$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific classicalization operator
- $\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific quantization operator
- $K_C^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base

Observer dimension is determined by its information processing capability:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

#### 2. Dimensional Network Dynamics

Observer dimension satisfies nonlinear dynamic equations:

$$\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})$$

Where the last term represents the collective effect of the observer network.

Consensus formation in the observer network follows:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2$$

Where $\omega_i$ is the observer weight and $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$ is the average classicalization operator.

#### 3. Measurement Theory

In observer theory, the quantum measurement process can be represented as:

$$|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \otimes \rho_A \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{U_{\text{interaction}}} \sum_{i,j} c_i c_j^* |i\rangle\langle j| \otimes |A_i\rangle\langle A_j| \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_O} |i_0\rangle\langle i_0| \otimes |A_{i_0}\rangle\langle A_{i_0}| \otimes \rho_{O}^{i_0}$$

Measurement result probability is modulated by the observer resolution parameter $\eta_O$:

$$P(i_0||\psi\rangle) = |c_{i_0}|^2 \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_O|c_{i_0}|^2}}{\sum_j e^{\eta_O|c_j|^2}}$$

The relationship between observer energy resolution threshold and measurement resolution is:

$$\eta_O = \frac{\hbar}{k_B T} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{\bar{E}_0}\right)$$

#### 4. Observer Hierarchy Network

Observers form a multi-level network structure:

$$\mathcal{N} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}\}$$

Where $\mathcal{O}^{(k)}$ is the set of k-th level observers and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of cross-level connections.

Higher-level observers perceive larger spatiotemporal scales:

$$L^{(k)} \approx L^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}, \quad T^{(k)} \approx T^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}$$

This explains why higher-dimensional observers can perceive spatiotemporal patterns at larger scales.
