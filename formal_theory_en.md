## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified to three core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a Quantum Domain $\Omega_Q$ and a Classical Domain $\Omega_C$, connected through an Interface Domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe, but can be converted between quantum information and classical information:

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that perform quantum→classical conversion, and their conversion ability determines their dimension:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

All other theoretical content can be derived from these three axioms.

### Extended Definition of Dual Domains

The Quantum Domain $\Omega_Q$ is the space of wave function superposition states of infinite possibilities, following quantum mechanical laws:

$$\Psi_Q = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

The Classical Domain $\Omega_C$ is the deterministic reality space, composed of classical knowledge and classical entropy:

$$\Omega_C = \{K_C + S_C | K_C \text{ is the set of classical knowledge}, S_C \text{ is classical entropy}\}$$

The Interface Domain $\mathcal{I}$ is the boundary region where quantum and classical conversions occur, defined through the disentanglement measure:

$$\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} \mid \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}$$

where $\mathcal{D}(x)$ is the disentanglement measure, and $\mathcal{D}_c$ is the critical disentanglement threshold.

## Quantum and Classical Domains

The fundamental characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized as follows:

### Quantum Domain Core Properties

1. **Wave Function Superposition State** (Chaotic State):
   $$\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

2. **Quantum Entangled State** (Energy Form):
   $$\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**:
   $$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

### Classical Domain Core Properties

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information):
   $$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty):
   $$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

3. **Locality and Determinism**:
   $$P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)$$

## Information-Energy-Spacetime Unified Theory

In the dualism framework, information, energy, and spacetime constitute the triple foundation of the universe, interconnected through the following unified equations:

### Unified Field Equation

The information-energy-spacetime unified field equation can be expressed as:

$$\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{R}g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu} = \kappa \cdot \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}I_{\Omega}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}$ is the generalized spacetime curvature tensor
- $\mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu}$ is the information-energy tensor
- $I_{\Omega}$ is the information density field of region $\Omega$
- $\kappa$ is the information-spacetime coupling constant

### Information-Energy Equivalence Principle

Based on dualism, information and energy satisfy a precise conversion relationship:

$$E_{\Omega} = \hbar \omega \cdot I_{\Omega} \cdot \eta(D_{\mathcal{O}})$$

where $\eta(D_{\mathcal{O}})$ is the observer dimension-related conversion efficiency function:

$$\eta(D_{\mathcal{O}}) = 1 - e^{-\alpha D_{\mathcal{O}}}$$

### Spacetime Emergence Mechanism

Spacetime structure emerges from quantum information networks, satisfying:

$$g_{\mu\nu} = f\left(\langle\Psi|\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}|\Psi\rangle, \mathcal{N}_{\text{connectivity}}, I_{\text{entanglement}}\right)$$

where:
- $\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}$ is the quantum energy-momentum operator
- $\mathcal{N}_{\text{connectivity}}$ is the quantum node connection topology
- $I_{\text{entanglement}}$ is the system's entanglement information amount

## Interface Dynamics

The quantum-classical interface has dynamic properties, described by the following equations:

### Enhanced Quantum-Classical Interface Dynamics Model

The interface dynamics equation can be formulated as:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)$$

where:
- $\alpha$ is the interface diffusion coefficient
- $\beta$ is the bistable potential parameter
- $\mathcal{D}_0$ is the secondary stable threshold ($\mathcal{D}_0 < \mathcal{D}_c$)
- $\gamma\xi(x,t)$ is the quantum noise term

This bistable model explains why the interface region has metastable properties, where small perturbations near the critical point can lead to quantum-classical phase transitions across the entire region.

### Interface Wave Equation

Introducing the interface wave function $\Phi_{\mathcal{I}}(x,t)$ to describe interface wave characteristics:

$$\left(\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{v_{\mathcal{I}}^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\right)\Phi_{\mathcal{I}}(x,t) = \rho_{\mathcal{I}}(x,t)$$

where $v_{\mathcal{I}}$ is the interface wave propagation speed, and $\rho_{\mathcal{I}}(x,t)$ is the interface information source term. This equation describes how interface waves transmit quantum-classical conversion information.

### Interface Migration Equation

The interface position evolves with information flow:

$$\vec{v}_{\mathcal{I}} = \kappa \nabla(\Gamma_{Q\rightarrow C}) - \lambda\vec{n}\kappa_{\mathcal{I}}$$

where $\kappa_{\mathcal{I}}$ is the interface curvature, and $\vec{n}$ is the interface normal vector.

> See [Interface Theory](formal_theory_interface_en.md) for complete interface theory.

## Observer Network Theory

Observers play a central role in quantum-classical dualism, forming a multi-level network structure:

### Complete Observer Hierarchy Network Model

The observer network can be represented as a multi-level structure:

$$\mathcal{N} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}\}$$

where $\mathcal{O}^{(k)}$ is the set of level k observers, and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of cross-level connections.

Information flow between levels satisfies:

$$I_{k \rightarrow k+1} = \mathcal{F}(\{I_i^{(k)}\}) - S_{\text{transmission loss}}$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is the inter-level information integration function, achieved through higher-order classicalization.

### Cross-Dimensional Observer Interaction Mechanism

Interactions between observers of different dimensions satisfy the symmetry principle:

$$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{O}_i \leftrightarrow \mathcal{O}_j) = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{O}_j \leftrightarrow \mathcal{O}_i) \cdot \frac{D_{\mathcal{O}_i}}{D_{\mathcal{O}_j}} \cdot \Phi_{\text{shared}}(i,j)$$

where $\Phi_{\text{shared}}(i,j)$ is the observer shared semantic space function, satisfying:

$$\Phi_{\text{shared}}(i,j) = \frac{|K_C^i \cap K_C^j|}{|K_C^i \cup K_C^j|} \cdot e^{-\lambda|D_{\mathcal{O}_i} - D_{\mathcal{O}_j}|}$$

This explains why there exists an essential barrier in information exchange between cross-dimensional observers.

### Observer Spatiotemporal Perception Scale

The higher the observer's hierarchy, the larger the spatiotemporal scale they perceive, in an exponential relationship:

$$L^{(k)} \approx L^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}, \quad T^{(k)} \approx T^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}$$

This explains why higher-dimensional observers can perceive larger-scale spatiotemporal patterns.

> See [Observer Theory](formal_theory_observer_en.md) for detailed observer theory.

## Unified Measurement Model

The quantum measurement process receives a unified explanation in the dualism framework:

### Unified Measurement Theory in the Dualism Framework

In the dualism framework, the quantum measurement process can be uniformly expressed as:

$$|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \otimes \rho_A \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{U_{\text{interaction}}} \sum_{i,j} c_i c_j^* |i\rangle\langle j| \otimes |A_i\rangle\langle A_j| \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_O} |i_0\rangle\langle i_0| \otimes |A_{i_0}\rangle\langle A_{i_0}| \otimes \rho_{O}^{i_0}$$

Here we introduce the measurement resolution parameter $\eta_O$, characterizing the observer's classicalization capability:

$$P(i_0||\psi\rangle) = |c_{i_0}|^2 \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_O|c_{i_0}|^2}}{\sum_j e^{\eta_O|c_j|^2}}$$

When $\eta_O \rightarrow \infty$, the standard Born rule is recovered;
When $\eta_O \rightarrow 0$, the observer cannot distinguish different measurement results.

### Measurement Resolution and Energy Threshold Relationship

The observer's measurement resolution $\eta_O$ has a precise relationship with their energy threshold $E_{\text{threshold}}$:

$$\eta_O = \frac{\hbar}{k_B T} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{\bar{E}_0}\right)$$

where $\bar{E}_0$ is the system's basic energy level, and $T$ is the observer's effective temperature. This explains why quantum effects are difficult to observe in macroscopic high-temperature environments.

### Dualism Analysis of Non-Commuting Observables

Non-commuting observables $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ satisfying $[\hat{A},\hat{B}] \neq 0$ are explained in dualism as:

$$\mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}}(\rho) \neq \mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}}(\rho)$$

and

$$\mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}} \circ \mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}}(\rho) \neq \mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}} \circ \mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}}(\rho)$$

The classicalization operators $\mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}}$ project the quantum state onto different and incompatible classical knowledge subspaces, resulting in measurement order determining the final observation result.

This can be expressed as a classicalization entropy increase relationship:

$$S(\mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}} \circ \mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}}(\rho)) - S(\mathcal{C}_{\hat{B}} \circ \mathcal{C}_{\hat{A}}(\rho)) = k \cdot ||[\hat{A},\hat{B}]||_{\text{HS}} \cdot S(\rho)$$

where $||[\hat{A},\hat{B}]||_{\text{HS}}$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the commutator.

## Experimental Verification Predictions

Quantum-Classical Dualism proposes the following specific predictions that can be verified through experiments in the near future:

### Key Verifiable Predictions

1. **Interface Temperature Dependence**: The quantum-classical interface position $\mathcal{D}_c$ satisfies a definite temperature relationship:
   $$\mathcal{D}_c(T) = \mathcal{D}_c(0) \cdot \tanh\left(\frac{T_0}{T}\right)$$
   
   This can be verified through precise measurements of quantum coherence changes with temperature in mesoscopic systems.

2. **Critical Scale Scaling Law**: The transition from quantum to classical satisfies the universal scaling law:
   $$L_{\text{critical}} \approx \lambda_{\text{de Broglie}} \cdot \left(\frac{m}{m_{\text{electron}}}\right)^{\alpha} \cdot \left(\frac{k_BT}{\text{eV}}\right)^{-\beta}$$
   
   with predictions $\alpha \approx 0.33$, $\beta \approx 0.5$.

3. **Bandwidth-Precision Trade-off Relationship**: Quantum information→classical information conversion satisfies:
   $$\text{Bandwidth} \times \text{Precision} \leq \frac{k_BT}{\hbar} \cdot \ln 2$$
   
   This can be verified through intermediate measurement efficiency experiments in quantum computers.

4. **Biological Quantum Fluctuations**: The quantum-classical interface fluctuations in living biological cells have a characteristic frequency:
   $$f_{\text{biological}} \approx \frac{k_BT}{h} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{I_{\text{metabolism}}}{I_0}\right)$$
   
   where $I_{\text{metabolism}}$ is the cell's metabolic rate, verifiable through high-precision quantum coherence measurements.

5. **Observer Resolution Prediction**: The observer dimension and the number of quantum states $N$ they can distinguish satisfy:
   $$N \approx e^{\gamma \cdot D_{\mathcal{O}}}$$
   
   where $\gamma \approx 0.25 \pm 0.05$, verifiable through cognitive science experiments.

## Cross-disciplinary Integration Framework

Quantum-Classical Dualism can serve as a cross-disciplinary unification framework, connecting different fields:

| Discipline | Quantum Domain Correspondence | Classical Domain Correspondence | Classicalization Mechanism |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Physics | Quantum States | Classical Physical Quantities | Decoherence/Measurement |
| Biology | Quantum Biochemical Networks | Phenotype/Function | Enzymatic Stabilization |
| Psychology | Subconscious/Intuition | Conscious/Rational | Attention Focus |
| Sociology | Individual Diversity | Social Norms | Collective Consensus Formation |
| Computational Science | Parallel Possibilities | Deterministic Algorithms | Computational Collapse |
| Economics | Market Possibilities | Price/Transactions | Market Decisions |
| Linguistics | Semantic Space | Concrete Expressions | Language Formalization |

Through this unified framework, special phenomena in various disciplines can be viewed as specialized manifestations of the universal dual structure.

### Quantum-Classical Interface Dynamics in Biological Systems

Biological systems maintain themselves near the quantum-classical interface, satisfying:

$$\mathcal{D}_{\text{biological}}(x,t) \approx \mathcal{D}_c \pm \delta(x,t)$$

By actively controlling $\delta(x,t)$ fluctuations, biological systems can simultaneously leverage the advantages of both quantum and classical domains:

1. **Quantum Tunneling Optimization**: Enzymatic reactions enhance quantum tunneling effects by adjusting $\delta(x,t) < 0$, lowering energy barriers:
   $$k_{\text{enzyme}} = k_{\text{classical}} \cdot e^{\alpha|\delta(x,t)|}$$

2. **Information Stable Storage**: Neural memory improves information stability by maintaining $\delta(x,t) > 0$:
   $$\tau_{\text{memory}} = \tau_0 \cdot e^{\beta\delta(x,t)}$$

3. **Quantum-Classical Information Conversion**: Perception processes dynamically adjust $\delta(x,t)$ in the interface region, achieving:
   $$\mathcal{C}_{\text{perception}}(\rho_{\text{environment}}) \rightarrow K_C^{\text{perception}} + S^{\text{regulated}}$$

### Consciousness in Dualism Model

Consciousness can be understood in the dualism framework as a dynamic regulation process of the quantum-classical interface:

$$\Psi_{\text{consciousness}} = \mathcal{Q}_{\text{subconscious}} \circ \mathcal{I}_{\text{interface}} \circ \mathcal{C}_{\text{conscious}}$$

where the three components work together:
1. Subconscious $\mathcal{Q}$ performs large-scale parallel information processing in the quantum domain
2. Interface layer $\mathcal{I}$ dynamically regulates information flow, controlling $\delta(x,t)$ fluctuations
3. Conscious $\mathcal{C}$ builds stable reality models in the classical domain

Consciousness state transitions satisfy:

$$\frac{d\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}}{dt} = -i\hat{H}_Q \Psi_{\text{consciousness}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{interface}}[\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}] + \mathcal{D}_{\text{classical}}[\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}]$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{interface}}$ is the interface regulation term, and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{classical}}$ is the classicalization dissipation term.

### Quantum-Classical Duality in AI Systems

AI systems can be understood in the dualism framework as quantum simulation structures on classical foundations:

1. **Quantum Interpretation of Neural Networks**: Multi-layer neural networks formally simulate quantum superposition and interference:
   $$f_{\text{NN}}(x) = \sum_i w_i \sigma\left(\sum_j w_{ij}x_j\right) \approx \sum_i \langle\phi_i|\hat{U}|x\rangle$$

2. **Dualism Expression of Attention Mechanism**: Attention mechanisms simulate classicalization processes, extracting definite information from possible state sets:
   $$\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \approx \mathcal{C}_{Q}(\rho_{K,V})$$

3. **Dualism-Inspired AI Architecture**: New AI architectures can be designed with reference to the quantum-classical dualism framework:
   $$\text{Quantum Layer} \rightarrow \text{Classicalization Layer} \rightarrow \text{Classical Reasoning Layer} \rightarrow \text{Quantization Layer} \rightarrow \text{Quantum Layer}$$
