## Theory Core Overview

Quantum-Classical Digital Transformation Theory applies the Quantum-Classical Dualism framework to analyze the interaction mechanisms between digital technologies and human society, revealing that the digitalization process simultaneously possesses the creativity and possibilities of the quantum domain and the determinism and structural characteristics of the classical domain. This theory explains how digital technology changes social information flow patterns, reconstructing human experience, organizational forms, and social relationships through the special attributes of the quantum-classical interface. Digital transformation is not just a technological change, but a profound information state phase transition, in which digital and physical reality interact through complex interfaces to form new types of mixed reality. By revealing the quantum-classical information conversion mechanisms in the digital transformation process, this theory proposes a development path for the harmonious coexistence of digital and physical reality, providing a theoretical basis for addressing social, ethical, and existential challenges brought by digitalization, while offering guidance for designing more humane and sustainable digital futures.

## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Formal Definition of Digital Transformation

Digital transformation $`\mathcal{D}`$ can be formally defined as:

Where $`\bowtie`$ represents the reality fusion operation.

**Axiom 4: Digital-Social Co-evolution**  
There exists a co-evolutionary relationship between digital technology and social systems:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{D} \\ \mathcal{S} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} F_D(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{S}) \\ F_S(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{D}) \end{pmatrix}$$

## Key Processes in Digital Transformation

### Digital Information Ecosystem

Formal representation of the digital information ecosystem:

$$\mathcal{E}_{digital} = (P_D, C_D, F_D, R_D)$$

Where:
- $`P_D`$ is the set of information producers
- $`C_D`$ is the set of information consumers

### Digital Society Adaptation and Adjustment

Adaptation process of social systems to digitalization:

## Relationships with Other Theory Branches

### Connection with Quantum Social Dynamics

Digital transformation is a special application scenario of quantum social dynamics:

$$\mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{S}_Q$$

Quantum superposition of digital society and traditional society:

$$|\Psi_{society}\rangle = \alpha_t|S_{traditional}\rangle + \alpha_d|S_{digital}\rangle$$

Where $`|\alpha_t|^2 + |\alpha_d|^2 = 1`$, with the proportion evolving over time.

### Connection with Quantum-Classical Interaction Technologies

Digital transformation extensively applies interaction technologies as implementation mechanisms:

$$\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{IT}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{E})$$

Where $`\mathcal{IT}`$ is the set of interaction technologies, $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the social system, and $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the environment.

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial \mathcal{IT}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial \mathcal{IT}} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial \mathcal{S}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{S}}{\partial \mathcal{IT}} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial \mathcal{E}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \mathcal{IT}}$$

### Connection with Virtual Reality Theory

Digital transformation shares theoretical foundations with virtual reality:

$$\mathcal{D} \cap \mathcal{VR} = \mathcal{MR}$$

Mixed reality is the intersection of digital transformation and virtual reality.

Mechanism by which virtual reality accelerates digital transformation:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}}{dt} = \frac{d\mathcal{D}}{dt}\bigg|_{base} + \alpha_{VR} \cdot \mathcal{VR}(t)$$

Where $`\alpha_{VR}`$ is the acceleration factor of virtual reality.
