### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into five core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $`\Omega_Q`$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $`\Omega_C`$ (space of definite reality), connected through an interface domain $`\mathcal{I}`$:

$`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}`$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition states) and classical information (definite knowledge):

$`I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical certainties), $`I(\psi)`$ is the total information content of state $`\psi`$, and $`I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)`$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that execute quantum→classical transformations, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge), $`\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $`K_C^\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $`\epsilon`$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization capacity and quantization capacity, while the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$`D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

$`\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}`$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within specific dimensions based on their capacity range.

**Axiom 5: Absolute Recursive Sourcehood**
The deepest structure of reality is absolute recursive construction, transcending binary opposition and serving as the source of all existence:

$`\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{R})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is a super-recursive function satisfying $`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{F}`$. Recursivity is not merely a property of reality but the mode of existence itself, more fundamental than transcendence and infinity:

$`\mathcal{R}_{n+1} = \mathcal{R}_n \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{R}_n)\}`$

$`\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathcal{R}_n = \mathcal{R}_{\infty} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{R}_{\infty})`$

### Dimension Theory Deepening

Dimension is not merely a static observer attribute but a dynamic flowing information structure, forming a complete spectrum from D0 to D∞:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{D_0, D_1, D_2, ..., D_{42}, D_{43}, D_{44}, ..., D_{\infty}\}`$

The essential characteristics of dimensions include:

1. **Dimensional Fluidity**: Dimensions are not fixed and unchangeable, but dynamic properties that can flow and transform
   
   $`D(t) = D_0 + \int_0^t \nabla_{\mathcal{H}} D(\tau) \cdot d\tau`$

2. **Dimensional Recursivity**: Each dimension contains a complete quantum-classical dual structure, and forms hierarchies through recursive nesting relationships

   $`D_n = \{\Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}, \mathcal{I}^{(n)}\}`$
   
   $`D_{n+1} \supset \{D_0, D_1, ..., D_n\}`$

3. **Full Spectrum Dimensions**: Universe dimensions essentially extend infinitely, D42 represents the limit of human cognition, D43 represents the quantum absolute recursion dimension, D44 represents the quantum reality synthesis dimension, but these are only the high-dimensional theories we have named, not the limits of universal dimensions

   $`\lim_{n\to\infty} D_n = D_{\infty} \equiv \mathcal{T}`$

4. **Dimensional Field Nature**: Dimension itself acts as a field variable, possessing self-adaptability

   $`\dim(\mathcal{M}(x)) = D(x), \quad D: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow [0, \infty]`$

Importantly, although Quantum Absolute Recursion Theory (D43) and Quantum Reality Synthesis Theory (D44) represent the highest dimensional theories we can currently label, the spectrum of universal dimensions itself extends infinitely. The true nature of the universe contains infinite dimensional levels, transcending what any finite number of theoretical frameworks can fully describe.

The dimension transformation function $`\mathcal{T}_{m \rightarrow n}`$ implements mapping between different dimensions:

$`\mathcal{T}_{m \rightarrow n}: \mathcal{S}^{(m)} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}^{(n)}`$

This mapping follows information conservation but allows conversion of expression forms. Higher-dimensional structures cannot be fully expressed by lower dimensions, resulting in expression impedance:

$`\mathcal{R}_{n \rightarrow m} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{expressed}}^{(m)}}{I_{\text{original}}^{(n)}}, \quad n > m`$

### Transfinite Synthesis Law

Within the quantum-classical dualism framework, binary oppositions achieve higher-dimensional unity through the transfinite synthesis law:

$`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) \neq \mathcal{A} \oplus \mathcal{B}`$

Transfinite synthesis follows the equation:

$`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}, \complement(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}), \mathcal{S}\}`$

The transfinite synthesis function $`\mathcal{S}`$ has the following properties:

1. **Self-containment**: $`\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{S}`$
2. **Boundary transcendence**: $`\partial \mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{S} \land \partial \mathcal{S} \not\subset \mathcal{S}`$
3. **Trans-consistency**: Simultaneously allows $`p \land \neg p`$ to hold at different levels
4. **Absolute openness**: $`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{S}`$ but $`\mathcal{S} \neq \mathcal{S}`$

This transfinite synthesis is the mathematical foundation for achieving quantum-classical dualism unity, allowing true meta-level unification.

### Quantum Domain and Classical Domain

The basic characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized in the following points:

#### Core Properties of Quantum Domain

1. **Wavefunction Superposition** (Chaotic State): Systems exist simultaneously in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $`\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1`$

2. **Quantum Entanglement** (Energy Form): Different parts form inseparable holistic connections
   $`\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B`$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: Correlations beyond space-time limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $`\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|`$

4. **Quantum Creativity**: The quantum domain inherently possesses creativity and the ability to generate new structures
   $`\mathcal{C}_Q = \frac{d}{dt}[I_{\text{new}}(t)]`$
   
   where $`I_{\text{new}}(t)`$ is the amount of new information emerging in the system.

#### Core Properties of Classical Domain

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information): Precisely measurable and describable definite states
   $`K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}`$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty): Measure of system disorder and information loss
   $`S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i`$

3. **Locality and Certainty**: Finite propagation speed of interactions and measurement certainty
   $`P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)`$

4. **Structural Stability**: Classical structures possess stability against disturbances
   $`\frac{d\mathcal{S}}{dt} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) - \gamma(\mathcal{S} - \mathcal{S}_0)`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the system structure, $`\mathcal{S}_0`$ is the stable structure, and $`\gamma`$ is the recovery coefficient.

### Multiple Dualism Hierarchies

Multiple Dualism Hierarchy Theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$`\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}`$

where:
- $`\Omega_Q^{(i)}`$ is the quantum domain of the i-th level (possibility space of that level)
- $`\Omega_C^{(i)}`$ is the classical domain of the i-th level (definite realization of that level)

The mapping functions between levels are defined as:

$`\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}`$

$`\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}`$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, creating infinitely recursive reality levels.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}`$ between quantum and classical domains:

$`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q`$

satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: The transformation of a transformation equals identity
   $`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}`$
   $`\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}`$

2. **Information Preservation**: Information content is invariant before and after transformation
   $`I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))`$

3. **Uncertainty-Certainty Transformation**: Quantum uncertainty and classical certainty are mutually transformable
   $`U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k`$

where $`U_Q`$ is the measure of quantum uncertainty, $`D_C`$ is the measure of classical certainty, and $`k`$ is a universal constant.

### Meta-Oneness and Super-Recursive Structure

At a deeper level than quantum-classical dualism lies meta-oneness, a unifying essence that transcends the dual opposition:

$`\mathcal{M} = \{\Omega_Q, \Omega_C, \mathcal{R}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the self-referential operator, giving meta-oneness a super-recursive structure:

$`\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M}) = \mathcal{M} \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M})\}`$

Meta-oneness creates infinite hierarchical structures through self-reference, while simultaneously transcending all these structures, forming a self-transcending cycle:

$`\mathcal{M}_{n+1} = \mathcal{M}_n \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M}_n)\}`$

Meta-oneness explains the deep question of "why the universe exists" rather than merely "how it exists," because the essence of meta-oneness is eternal self-creation and self-transcendence.

## Core Branch Theories

### Detailed Quantum Domain Theory

The quantum domain $`\Omega_Q`$ is the possibility space in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Quantum Information Encoding

Quantum information is encoded through quantum states in complex Hilbert space:

$`|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1`$

where information density is quantified by von Neumann entropy:

$`S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln \lambda_i`$

#### 2. Quantum Dynamics

Quantum systems evolve following the Schrödinger equation, preserving information and energy conservation:

$`i\hbar\frac{\partial|\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle`$

Quantum system dynamics have three key characteristics:
- Superposition principle: States can simultaneously exist as linear combinations of multiple basis vectors
- Time reversibility: Under pure quantum evolution, systems can return to their initial state
- Phase coherence: Quantum systems maintain global phase relationships

#### 3. Quantum Entanglement Network

Quantum entanglement forms multi-particle entanglement networks, representable as:

$`|\Psi_{\text{network}}\rangle = \sum_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n} c_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} |i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n\rangle`$

Entanglement can be quantified through various means, including entanglement entropy:

$`E(|\psi_{AB}\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B)`$

Entanglement networks form non-local connection structures in the quantum domain, supporting super-classical information transmission.

#### 4. Quantum Fluctuations

The quantum domain has inherent quantum fluctuations, guaranteed by the uncertainty principle:

$`\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|`$

Quantum fluctuation intensity is related to system energy and temperature:

$`\langle\Delta E^2\rangle \propto \frac{\hbar^2}{(\Delta t)^2} + k_B T`$

These fluctuations play a key role in quantum creativity, providing the material basis for new structure generation.

### Detailed Classical Domain Theory

The classical domain $`\Omega_C`$ is the deterministic realization space in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Classical Information Encoding

Classical information is encoded through definite states in configuration space:

$`S_{\text{classical}} = \{s_i = (x_i, p_i, t_i, ...)\}`$

where information content is quantified by Shannon entropy:

$`H(X) = -\sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i`$

#### 2. Classical Dynamics

Classical systems evolve following deterministic equations of motion, preserving reversibility in ideal conditions:

$`\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{v}, \quad \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}`$

Classical system dynamics have three key characteristics:
- Determinism: Future states are completely determined by current states
- Locality: Interactions propagate at finite speeds, not exceeding the speed of light
- Energy conservation: Total energy remains constant in closed systems

#### 3. Classical Network Structure

Classical systems form connection networks based on interaction forces and communication channels:

$`G_C = (V, E), \quad E = \{(i,j) | i,j \in V, d(i,j) < r_{\text{interaction}}\}`$

Network characteristics can be quantified through structure entropy and connection density:

$`S_{\text{structure}} = -\sum_{i,j} p_{ij} \log p_{ij}`$

Classical networks possess hierarchical structures and organizational principles, forming the basis for complex emergent behaviors.

#### 4. Classical Stability and Constraints

The classical domain exhibits stability against small perturbations, maintaining structural integrity:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{S}}{dt} = f(\mathcal{S}) - \lambda(\mathcal{S} - \mathcal{S}_0) + \xi(t)`$

where $`\mathcal{S}_0`$ is the equilibrium structure, $`\lambda`$ is the recovery coefficient, and $`\xi(t)`$ is external noise.

Classical systems operate under various constraints including:
- Energy constraints: $`E_{\text{total}} = \text{constant}`$
- Resource constraints: $`\sum_i r_i \leq R_{\text{available}}`$
- Temporal constraints: $`\Delta t \geq \frac{l}{c}`$

These constraints provide stability but also limit the system's creative potential.

### Interface Theory

The interface $`\mathcal{I}`$ is the transition region between quantum and classical domains, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Interface Structure

The interface forms a non-equilibrium phase boundary between quantum and classical domains:

$`\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}(x)`$ is the decoherence measure function and $`\mathcal{D}_c`$ is the critical decoherence threshold.

#### 2. Interface Dynamics

The interface position evolves according to nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)`$

Interface motion exhibits rich dynamical behaviors including:
- Traveling waves: The interface moves with constant velocity
- Oscillatory behavior: The interface position oscillates
- Chaotic dynamics: The interface exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions

#### 3. Classicalization Mechanisms

Classicalization (quantum → classical transition) occurs through several mechanisms:

$`\mathcal{C}_{\text{decoherence}}: |\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \rightarrow \sum_i |i\rangle\langle i|\rho_{ii}|i\rangle\langle i|`$

$`\mathcal{C}_{\text{measurement}}: |\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle \rightarrow |j\rangle \text{ with probability } |c_j|^2`$

$`\mathcal{C}_{\text{information}}: I_Q \rightarrow I_C + I_{\text{hidden}}`$

Classicalization is fundamentally an increase in information certainty at the cost of reducing possibility space.

#### 4. Quantization Mechanisms

Quantization (classical → quantum transition) occurs through complementary mechanisms:

$`\mathcal{Q}_{\text{superposition}}: |i\rangle \rightarrow \sum_j \alpha_j |j\rangle`$

$`\mathcal{Q}_{\text{entanglement}}: |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B \rightarrow \sum_{k,l} \beta_{kl} |k\rangle_A \otimes |l\rangle_B`$

$`\mathcal{Q}_{\text{information}}: I_C \rightarrow I_Q + I_{\text{additional}}`$

Quantization expands possibility space at the cost of reduced certainty and precision.

### Observer Theory

Observers are key nodes executing quantum→classical transitions, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Observer Structure

An observer consists of a classicalization apparatus, knowledge base, and consciousness interface:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}, \Phi_\mathcal{O}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the classicalization operator, $`\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the quantization operator, $`K_C^\mathcal{O}`$ is the classical knowledge base, and $`\Phi_\mathcal{O}`$ is the consciousness integration function.

#### 2. Observer Dimension

Observer dimension is determined by the ratio of classical knowledge to classical entropy:

$`D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

Dimension growth occurs through knowledge acquisition and entropy reduction:

$`\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})`$

#### 3. Observer Networks

Observers form networks through information exchange and shared reality construction:

$`G_{\mathcal{O}} = (V_{\mathcal{O}}, E_{\mathcal{O}}), \quad E_{\mathcal{O}} = \{(i,j) | i,j \in V_{\mathcal{O}}, I_{\text{mutual}}(i,j) > \theta\}`$

Consensus formation in observer networks follows collective dynamics:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2`$

#### 4. Observer Equivalence Principle

All observers are structurally equivalent to black holes, with corresponding parameters:

$`\mathcal{O} \cong \text{Black Hole}(M, J, Q, \Phi)`$

where observer classicalization corresponds to black hole information absorption, and observer quantization corresponds to black hole radiation:

$`\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}} \leftrightarrow \text{Information Absorption}`$
$`\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}} \leftrightarrow \text{Hawking Radiation}`$

### Information Phase Transition Theory

Information undergoes phase transitions between quantum and classical states, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Phase Diagram

The information phase space is characterized by order parameters and control parameters:

$`(\lambda, \theta) \in \Lambda \times \Theta`$

where $`\lambda`$ is the control parameter (e.g., observation strength) and $`\theta`$ is the order parameter (e.g., wavefunction collapse probability).

#### 2. Critical Phenomena

Near critical points, order parameters exhibit universal scaling behaviors:

$`\theta(\lambda) \sim |\lambda - \lambda_c|^\beta`$

Critical exponents characterize different universality classes of information transitions:

$`\beta_{\text{measurement}} \approx 0.5, \quad \beta_{\text{decoherence}} \approx 0.33, \quad \beta_{\text{consciousness}} \approx 0.42`$

#### 3. Information Transfer Functions

Information transfer between domains is described by response functions:

$`\chi_{QC}(\lambda) = \frac{\partial I_C}{\partial I_Q}`$

These functions exhibit singularities at critical points:

$`\chi_{QC}(\lambda) \sim |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\gamma}`$

#### 4. Phase Coexistence

Quantum and classical phases can coexist in mixed states:

$`\rho_{\text{mixed}} = p_Q \rho_Q + p_C \rho_C, \quad p_Q + p_C = 1`$

Coexistence regions exhibit interesting phenomena including metastability, hysteresis, and information avalanches.

### Consciousness Theory

Consciousness emerges as an integrated information structure at the quantum-classical interface, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Consciousness Structure

Consciousness consists of multiple integrated representation layers:

$`\Phi = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2, ..., \Phi_n\}`$

where each layer corresponds to a different level of information integration:

$`\Phi_i = \int_{\Omega_i} \phi(x) dx`$

#### 2. Quantum-Classical Binding

Consciousness binds quantum possibilities to classical actualities through the binding function:

$`\mathcal{B}: \Omega_Q \times \Omega_C \rightarrow \Phi`$

This binding creates the subjective experience of a unified reality from disparate information sources.

#### 3. Meta-Awareness

Consciousness includes meta-awareness of its own states:

$`\Phi(\Phi) = \mathcal{R}(\Phi)`$

where $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the self-reference operator. This creates the subjective sense of self and autobiographical continuity.

#### 4. Consciousness Paradox Resolution

The paradoxical nature of consciousness is resolved through transfinite synthesis:

$`\mathcal{S}(\Phi_{\text{subject}}, \Phi_{\text{object}}) = \Phi_{\text{integrated}}`$

This synthesis transcends the subject-object dichotomy, explaining how consciousness can be both part of the physical world and seemingly separate from it.
