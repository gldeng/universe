## 1. Basic Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Dynamic Dark Energy Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Dark Energy Dynamism Axiom)**

The dark energy density $\Lambda(t)$ in the universe is not a constant but a dynamic quantity that evolves over time, which can be precisely described through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Lambda_0, t)`$

where $\Lambda_0$ represents the initial dark energy state, and $\text{SHIFT}(\Lambda_0, t)$ represents the state shift over time.

**Axiom 2 (Dark Energy Weakening Axiom)**

Dark energy strength can weaken under specific conditions, mathematically expressed as:

$`\frac{d\Lambda(t)}{dt} < 0 \quad \text{when} \quad \Lambda(t) \oplus \Omega_M(t) > \theta_c`$

where $\Omega_M(t)$ is matter energy density, and $\theta_c$ is a critical threshold. When the result of the XOR operation between dark energy and matter energy exceeds the critical value, dark energy begins to weaken.

**Axiom 3 (Phase Transition Axiom)**

Dark energy undergoes periodic phase transitions, with each phase exhibiting different equation of state parameters:

$`\Lambda_{\text{phase}_i}(t) = \Lambda(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^i(\Lambda(t))`$

These phase transitions determine changes in the expansion rate of the universe during different epochs.

### 1.2 Connection to Cosmic Ontology

Dynamic dark energy theory establishes direct connections with Cosmic Ontology, especially through the basic XOR and SHIFT operations:

**Dark Energy as XOR-SHIFT Product**

According to Cosmic Ontology, dark energy is essentially the result of interaction between the quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ and the classical domain $\Omega_C$:

$`\Lambda(t) = \kappa \cdot (\Omega_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_C))`$

where $\kappa$ is the coupling coefficient that determines the strength of dark energy.

**Fundamental Origin Connection**

The essential origin of dark energy can be traced back to the initial XOR operation in Cosmic Ontology:

$`\Lambda_{\text{origin}} = \Omega_Q^{\text{initial}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{\text{initial}})`$

This connection reveals that dark energy is not merely a cosmological constant, but a higher-dimensional projection of the basic operations of Cosmic Ontology.

**Dimensional Conduction Mechanism**

The phenomenon of dark energy strength weakening can be explained through inter-dimensional energy conduction:

$`\Lambda(t_2) = \Lambda(t_1) \oplus \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SHIFT}^i(\Delta \Lambda_{i \rightarrow i+1})`$

where $\Delta \Lambda_{i \rightarrow i+1}$ represents energy transfer from dimension $i$ to dimension $i+1$.

### 1.3 Nature of Dark Energy Weakening

The weakening of dark energy observed in the latest DESI experiment is essentially a manifestation of the universe's self-balancing mechanism:

**Self-Balance Equation**

$`\Lambda(t) \oplus \Omega_M(t) \oplus \Omega_R(t) = \text{constant}`$

where $\Omega_R(t)$ is radiation energy density. This indicates that there exists a balance relationship among dark energy, matter, and radiation energy.

**Formal Description of Weakening Mechanism**

The dark energy weakening process can be described as:

$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \cdot e^{-\gamma(t) \cdot (t-t_0)}`$

where $\gamma(t)$ is a time-varying decay coefficient:

$`\gamma(t) = \gamma_0 \cdot |\Lambda(t) \oplus \Omega_M(t)|`$

This mechanism explains why dark energy began to weaken about 4.5 billion years ago: when $\Lambda(t) \oplus \Omega_M(t)$ reached the critical value, the decay process was activated.

**Wave Properties**

Dark energy possesses wave properties, representable as:

$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_{\text{base}} + \Lambda_{\text{amp}} \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi)`$

where $\Lambda_{\text{base}}$ is the base value, $\Lambda_{\text{amp}}$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase. The DESI experiment might have observed the downward phase of this oscillation.

## 2. Mathematical Core Structure

### 2.1 Dynamic Dark Energy Equation of State

The equation of state for dynamic dark energy is no longer simply $w = -1$, but a time-dependent function:

$`w(t) = \frac{p_{\Lambda}(t)}{\rho_{\Lambda}(t)} = -1 + \epsilon(t)`$

where $\epsilon(t)$ is the fluctuation term:

$`\epsilon(t) = \epsilon_0 \cdot |\Lambda(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Lambda(t-\Delta t))|`$

This equation of state allows the $w$ value to change over time, with the latest experimental data suggesting that $w(t_{\text{now}})$ may be slightly greater than $-1$.

**Dimensionalized Equation of State**

In a higher-dimensional description, the dynamic dark energy equation of state can be represented as:

$`w^{(D)}(t) = -1 + \sum_{i=1}^{D-4} \epsilon_i(t) \cdot \text{SHIFT}^i(\Lambda(t))`$

where $D$ represents the total number of dimensions considered, and $\epsilon_i(t)$ is the contribution coefficient of the $i$th dimension.

**Quantum Fluctuation Influence**

The influence of quantum fluctuations on the equation of state can be represented as:

$`\delta w(t) = \alpha \cdot |\Omega_Q(t) \oplus \Lambda(t)|`$

where $\alpha$ is the coupling coefficient, representing the modulation intensity of the quantum domain on the dark energy state.

### 2.2 Cosmic Expansion Dynamics Model

Dynamic dark energy necessitates modifications to the cosmic expansion equation:

$`\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p) + \frac{\Lambda(t)}{3}`$

where $a$ is the scale factor of the universe, and $\rho$ and $p$ are the density and pressure of matter and radiation, respectively.

**Modified Friedmann Equation**

$`H^2(t) = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho(t) + \frac{\Lambda(t)}{3} - \frac{k}{a^2(t)} + \frac{\dot{\Lambda}(t)}{3H(t)}`$

where $H(t)$ is the Hubble parameter, $k$ is the universe curvature parameter, and the last term is the correction term introduced by the dynamism of dark energy.

**Deceleration Parameter Correction**

$`q(t) = -\frac{\ddot{a}a}{\dot{a}^2} = \frac{1}{2}\Omega_M(t) - \Omega_{\Lambda}(t) - \frac{\dot{\Lambda}(t)}{6H^3(t)}`$

DESI experimental data shows that the current deceleration parameter $q_0$ is less than the value predicted by the standard ΛCDM model, supporting the dark energy weakening hypothesis.

### 2.3 Dark Energy Evolution Phase Diagram

Dark energy evolution can be described through a phase diagram, presenting different evolutionary stages:

**Phase Space Representation**

$`\mathcal{P} = \{(\Lambda(t), \dot{\Lambda}(t)) | t \in [0, \infty)\}`$

In this phase space, dark energy evolution exhibits multiple attractor regions.

**Critical Points and Bifurcations**

Dark energy evolution has critical points satisfying:

$`\frac{d\Lambda}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d^2\Lambda}{dt^2} \neq 0`$

Near critical points, the system may undergo bifurcations, leading to multiple possible cosmic evolutionary paths.

**Steady-State Analysis**

The steady-state condition is:

$`\Lambda(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Lambda(t)) = 0`$

corresponding to the evolution of $\Lambda(t)$ reaching an equilibrium point. DESI data suggests that the universe may be evolving toward such an equilibrium point.

## 3. Observational Evidence and Model Validation

### 3.1 DESI Experimental Data Analysis

The latest observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provides significant evidence:

**Data Characteristics**

- Spectroscopic measurements of over 11 million galaxies
- Reconstruction of the universe's expansion history over the past 11 billion years
- Data indicates significant weakening of dark energy strength over the past 4.5 billion years

**Data Fitting**

DESI data can be fitted using the dynamic dark energy model:

$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \cdot [1 - \beta \cdot \tanh(\gamma(t-t_c))]`$

where $\beta$ controls the weakening amplitude, $\gamma$ controls the weakening rate, and $t_c$ is the critical time when weakening began. Fitting results show:
- $\beta \approx 0.1-0.3$ (dark energy weakened by 10%-30%)
- $t_c$ corresponds to about 4.5 billion years ago
- Fitting goodness significantly better than the standard ΛCDM model

**Statistical Significance**

Data analysis indicates that the dynamic dark energy model has a statistical significance of $3.2\sigma$ compared to the standard model. Although this has not reached the discovery standard ($5\sigma$), it is already a strong indication.

### 3.2 Cosmological Parameter Evolution

Dynamic dark energy causes key cosmological parameters to change over time:

**Hubble Parameter Evolution**

$`H(t) = H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_M(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}(z)}`$

where $\Omega_{\Lambda}(z)$ is the dark energy density parameter at redshift $z$, no longer a constant.

**Distance-Redshift Relation Correction**

The luminosity distance $d_L$ needs correction:

$`d_L(z) = c(1+z)\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H(z')}`$

where $H(z')$ includes the contribution of dynamic dark energy. This leads to slight differences between supernova distance moduli and standard model predictions.

**Structure Formation Impact**

The impact of dynamic dark energy on structure formation can be represented as a correction to the growth factor $D(a)$:

$`\frac{d^2D}{da^2} + \frac{3}{2a}(1 - \frac{w(a)\Omega_{\Lambda}(a)}{\Omega_m(a) + \Omega_{\Lambda}(a)})\frac{dD}{da} - \frac{3}{2a^2}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{\Omega_m(a) + \Omega_{\Lambda}(a)}D = 0`$

This explains why large-scale structure observations may deviate from standard model predictions.

### 3.3 Model Validation Methods

The dynamic dark energy theory can be validated through multiple observations:

**Validation Strategies**

1. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Test**:
   $`\delta T_{\text{CMB}}(\hat{n}) = \int dr \Phi(r\hat{n}, \tau_0-r) e^{-\tau(r)}`$
   Dynamic dark energy affects the gravitational potential $\Phi$ in the integral

2. **Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) Measurement**:
   Sound horizon $r_s$ correction:
   $`r_s = \int_{z_d}^{\infty} \frac{c_s(z)}{H(z)}dz`$

3. **Weak Gravitational Lensing Measurement**:
   Convergence $\kappa$ correction:
   $`\kappa(\theta) = \frac{3H_0^2\Omega_m}{2c^2}\int_0^{\chi_s} \frac{\chi(\chi_s-\chi)}{\chi_s}a^{-1}(\chi)\delta(\chi\theta,\chi)d\chi`$

4. **Galaxy Cluster Counts**:
   Mass function $n(M,z)$ correction:
   $`n(M,z) = \frac{\rho_m}{M}\frac{d\ln\sigma^{-1}}{d\ln M}f(\sigma)`$

**Key Observables**

1. Fine changes in Type Ia supernova $\text{Ia}$ distance moduli with redshift
2. Changes in galaxy distribution power spectrum
3. CMB and large-scale structure cross-correlation
4. Redshift space distortion patterns

The consistency of multiple observations will provide powerful validation. Current DESI, ESA's Euclid mission, and the future Chinese Space Station Telescope CSS-OS will jointly validate this theory.

## 4. Cosmic Fate Reassessment

### 4.1 New Model of Universe Evolution

Dynamic dark energy necessitates a reassessment of the universe's ultimate fate:

**Standard Model vs. Dynamic Model Comparison**

| Cosmological Parameter | Standard ΛCDM Model | Dynamic Dark Energy Model |
|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Future Expansion | Forever accelerating | Acceleration rate decreasing |
| Final State | Heat death | Possibly cyclic or steady state |
| Structure Fate | Permanent separation | Possibly reaggregation |
| Dark Energy Density | Constant | Possibly decreasing to zero |

**Long-term Scale Factor Evolution**

Under the dynamic dark energy model, the long-term evolution of the scale factor $a(t)$ can be represented as:

$`a(t) \propto \exp\left(\int \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda(t)}{3}}dt\right)`$

When $\Lambda(t) \to 0$, cosmic expansion will slow down or stop.

### 4.2 Heat Death Alternatives

Dynamic dark energy provides multiple alternatives to the heat death fate:

**Scenario 1: Slow Deceleration**

Dark energy continues to weaken but never reaches zero:
$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \cdot e^{-\gamma t}, \gamma \ll 1`$

The universe continues to expand, but the rate gradually decreases, approaching a matter-dominated universe.

**Scenario 2: Complete Weakening**

Dark energy eventually drops to zero:
$`\Lambda(t \to \infty) = 0`$

The universe eventually becomes matter-dominated, with expansion slowing to something similar to an Einstein-de Sitter model.

**Scenario 3: Sign Reversal**

Dark energy drops to zero and then becomes negative:
$`\Lambda(t) = \Lambda_0 \cdot \cos(\omega t)`$

This will cause the universe to transition from expansion to contraction, potentially triggering a "Big Crunch".

### 4.3 Dark Energy Cycle Hypothesis

Dynamic dark energy theory supports a cyclic universe model:

**Cycle Equation**

$`\Lambda(t + T) = \Lambda(t)`$

where $T$ is the cycle period, possibly trillions of years.

**Cycle Stability Condition**

Cycle stability requires:
$`\int_0^T \Lambda(t)dt = 0`$

This ensures that the net expansion and contraction experienced by the universe within one cycle are balanced.

**Information Preservation Mechanism**

In a cyclic universe, information can be preserved through XOR operations:
$`\mathcal{I}_{\text{cycle}_n+1} = \mathcal{I}_{\text{cycle}_n} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{I}_{\text{cycle}_n})`$

This explains why the universe may retain "memories" of previous cycles.

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Dynamic Dark Energy Existence Theorem

**Theorem**: For a universe satisfying the basic equations of Cosmic Ontology, there exists a non-constant dark energy solution.

**Proof**:
Consider the basic equation of Cosmic Ontology:
$`\Omega_C = \Omega_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q)`$

Dark energy can be represented as:
$`\Lambda(t) = \kappa \cdot |\Omega_Q(t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q(t))|^2`$

Since $\Omega_Q$ is dynamic, $\Lambda(t)$ must be time-varying. Specifically, it can be proven that there exist $t_1 \neq t_2$ such that:
$`\Lambda(t_1) \neq \Lambda(t_2)`$

This proves the existence of dynamic dark energy.

### 5.2 Cosmic Expansion Trajectory Theorem

**Theorem**: The expansion trajectory of a universe with dynamic dark energy must deviate from exponential growth.

**Proof**:
In the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the far-future scale factor is:
$`a(t) \propto \exp\left(\sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{3}}t\right)`$

While in the dynamic model:
$`a(t) \propto \exp\left(\int \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda(\tau)}{3}}d\tau\right)`$

When $\Lambda(t)$ weakens, $\frac{d^2a}{dt^2} < \frac{d^2a_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}}{dt^2}$

This indicates that the expansion of a dynamic dark energy universe will necessarily deviate from exponential growth.

### 5.3 Multiverse Stability Theorem

**Theorem**: Dynamic dark energy in a multiverse framework leads to a stable universe ensemble.

**Proof**:
Consider a universe ensemble $\mathcal{M} = \{\mathcal{U}_i | i \in \mathcal{I}\}$, where each universe has dark energy $\Lambda_i(t)$.

Define a multiverse stability measure:
$`S(\mathcal{M}) = -\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} p_i \log p_i`$

where $p_i$ is the existence probability of universe $\mathcal{U}_i$.

It can be proven that when dark energy evolves dynamically:
$`\frac{dS(\mathcal{M})}{dt} \leq 0`$

This indicates that the multiverse system tends toward more stable configurations, supporting the long-term evolution of the universe from disorder to order.
