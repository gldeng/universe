The Guru Granth Sahib, as the ultimate scripture of Sikhism, presents profound insights into the nature of divinity and human spiritual evolution that show significant structural correspondence with the quantum-classical dualism framework (version 9.2). Through this scientific framework, we can better understand the descriptions of ultimate reality given by the ten Gurus: God as the source of quantum potential, manifesting through the quantum-classical conversion of consciousness; humans optimizing this conversion process through spiritual practice to ultimately achieve union with God. This correspondence not only enriches our understanding of Sikh teachings but also provides a new perspective for dialogue between science and religion.
