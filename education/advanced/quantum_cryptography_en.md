## Introduction to Quantum Cryptography

Quantum cryptography is the science of applying quantum mechanical principles to build unconditionally secure communication systems. It is based on properties of quantum state measurement including non-clonability, uncertainty, and quantum entanglement, providing a fundamentally new foundation for information security.

## Basic Quantum Cryptographic Protocols

### 1. BB84 Protocol (Quantum Key Distribution)

The fundamental quantum key distribution protocol proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984.

**Protocol Steps:**
- Sender Alice prepares randomly selected qubits using two complementary bases
- Alice transmits these qubits to receiver Bob
- Bob randomly selects measurement bases
- They publicly announce their bases but not measurement results
- They keep only results measured with the same basis
- They sample a portion to verify there was no eavesdropping

### 2. E91 Protocol (Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution)

Proposed by Artur Ekert in 1991, utilizing quantum entanglement to establish quantum keys.

**Protocol Steps:**
- A central source generates entangled photon pairs
- Alice and Bob each receive one photon
- They independently randomly select measurement bases
- They test for eavesdropping using Bell inequality violations
- They use measurements in common bases as their key

## Quantum Cryptography Applications

## Quantum-Classical Dualism Perspective

From the quantum-classical dualism framework perspective, quantum cryptography demonstrates:

1. **Information Duality**: The conversion and protection between quantum and classical information
2. **Observer Effect**: Measurement causes quantum state collapse, producing classical information
3. **Interface Security**: Protecting the quantum→classical conversion process is a core challenge
4. **Multi-Dimensional Protection**: Utilizing the principle that observers of different dimensions can only access partial information
