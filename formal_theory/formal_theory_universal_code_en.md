## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Universal Code Existence Axiom)**

In the transformation process from primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ to primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, there exists an intermediate state, namely the Universal Code:

$`\text{UCODE} \in \mathcal{D}_{trans}, \mathcal{D}_{trans} = \{\omega | \mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \omega \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{trans}`$ is the transformation domain, connecting the pre-dimensional domain $`\mathcal{D}_{pre}`$ and the zero-dimensional domain $`\mathcal{D}_{0}`$.

**Axiom 2 (Universal Code Pre-Binary Axiom)**

Universal Code exhibits pre-binary characteristics, being neither a singular state nor a complete binary state, but rather a pre-binary state between the two:

$`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$

where $`◯`$ represents the void state, $`●`$ represents the existence state, and $`\rightsquigarrow`$ represents the pre-transformation relationship.

**Axiom 3 (Universal Code Encoding Axiom)**

Universal Code possesses primitive encoding functionality, capable of encoding all possible higher-dimensional structures in the most simplified form:

$`\forall \mathcal{X} \in \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{D}_n, \exists f_{\text{UCODE}}: \text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{X}`$

where $`f_{\text{UCODE}}`$ is the Universal Code encoding function, and $`\mathcal{D}_n`$ is the $`n`$-dimensional domain.

### 1.2 The Essence of Universal Code

The essence of Universal Code is the primitive encoding pattern of dimensional formation, existing in a critical state between formlessness and form. Strictly speaking, Universal Code can be represented as:

$`\text{UCODE} \equiv \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \approx \{\emptyset, \emptyset \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

Universal Code possesses dual properties:
1. As a concretization of primitive singularity, $`\text{UCODE}_{-} \sim \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$
2. As an abstract template for primitive point, $`\text{UCODE}_{+} \sim \mathcal{P}_0`$

Universal Code can be understood as the "genome" of the universe, containing the encoding potential for all possible structures, but existing in an extremely compressed form.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Universal Code

Universal Code has the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Binary Nature**: Universal Code contains both the void state $`◯`$ and the pre-transformation from void to existence $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$, forming the most primitive binary construct

2. **Pre-Encoding Capacity**: Universal Code contains the potential to encode all possible higher-dimensional structures
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \Omega_{\infty}`$, where $`\Omega_{\infty}`$ represents the set of all possible states

3. **Semi-Dimensionality**: Universal Code has dimension 0.5, indicating it exists in a transitional state between pre-dimension and dimensionality
   $`\dim(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5, \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 < \dim(\text{UCODE}) < \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0`$

4. **Pre-Information Capacity**: Universal Code has -0.5 bit of pre-information, representing a state between pre-information and zero information
   $`I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}, I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit} < I(\text{UCODE}) < I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Quasi-PRE-FLIP Operation**: Universal Code contains the prototype of the PRE-FLIP operation, which is the precursor of the FLIP operation
   $`\text{PRE-FLIP}_{potential} \in \text{UCODE}`$

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Universal Code

Universal Code evolves into the primitive point through inherent evolution patterns:

$`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$

This evolution follows specific pre-transformation rules:

$`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\} \rightsquigarrow \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. Stabilization of the pre-transformation relationship $`\rightsquigarrow`$
2. Concretization of the void state $`◯`$ into the primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$
3. Transformation of $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$ into the self-maintaining property of the primitive point: $`\mathcal{P}_0 = \mathcal{P}_0`$

Information change during the Universal Code evolution process:

$`I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit} \rightsquigarrow I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Information Capacity of Universal Code

From the Universal Code axiom system, its information properties can be directly derived:

1. **Pre-Information Existence Form**: The information of Universal Code manifests as potential encoding capacity, rather than actual state count
   $`I(\text{UCODE}) = \log_2(E_{\text{potential}})`$, where $`E_{\text{potential}}`$ represents potential encoding capacity

2. **Encoding Efficiency**: Universal Code has extremely high encoding efficiency, capable of expressing maximum information with minimum states
   $`\eta_{\text{UCODE}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{I(X_n)}{I(\text{UCODE})} = \infty`$, where $`X_n`$ is the $`n`$-dimensional structure encodable by Universal Code

3. **Encoding Compression Ratio**: Universal Code preserves information through extreme compression
   $`C_{\text{UCODE}} = \frac{I(f_{\text{UCODE}}(X))}{I(X)} \approx 0`$, indicating compression ratio approaching zero

4. **Potential Entropy Increase Trend**: When Universal Code expands, entropy exhibits exponential growth
   $`S(f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})) \gg S(\text{UCODE})`$

### 2.2 Symmetry Properties of Universal Code

Universal Code has the following symmetry properties:

1. **Pre-Symmetry**: Universal Code exhibits pre-symmetric properties, being neither completely symmetric nor asymmetric
   $`\text{Sym}(\text{UCODE}) = \{\text{pre-mirror}\}`$, where $`\text{pre-mirror}`$ represents pre-mirror transformation

2. **Symmetry Breaking Potential**: Universal Code contains seeds for all possible symmetry breaking
   $`\Delta\text{Sym} = \text{Sym}(\text{UCODE}) - \text{Sym}(\mathcal{P}_0) > 0`$

3. **Cyclic Symmetry**: Universal Code exhibits primitive cyclic properties
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE}`$, manifesting as pre-self-reference

4. **Dimensional Symmetry Transition**: Universal Code is the key node in symmetry transformation from negative dimension to zero dimension
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \stackrel{\text{UCODE}}{\rightsquigarrow} \mathcal{P}_0`$

### 2.3 Recursive Structure of Universal Code

Universal Code exhibits primitive recursive properties:

1. **Pre-Recursivity**: Universal Code contains primitive pre-recursive structures
   $`\text{UCODE} \subset f_{\text{UCODE}}(\text{UCODE})`$

2. **Self-Containment**: Universal Code contains itself in compressed form
   $`\text{UCODE} \in \text{UCODE}`$, although this containment is in pre-logical form

3. **Recursive Expansion Sequence**: Universal Code can recursively expand to form an infinite sequence
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow f_{\text{UCODE}}(\text{UCODE}) \rightsquigarrow f_{\text{UCODE}}(f_{\text{UCODE}}(\text{UCODE})) \rightsquigarrow ...$`

4. **Recursive Depth**: Universal Code recursion can reach arbitrary depth, but the initial layers are extremely simple
   $`D_{\text{recursion}}(\text{UCODE}) = \{0.5, \infty\}`$, simultaneously possessing shallow and infinite depth characteristics

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Relationship Between Universal Code and Primitive Point

A strict evolutionary relationship exists between Universal Code and the primitive point:

1. **Precedent Relationship**: Universal Code is the direct precursor of the primitive point
   $`\text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0`$
   
2. **Template Function**: Universal Code serves as the construction template for the primitive point
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 = f_{\text{manifest}}(\text{UCODE})`$, where $`f_{\text{manifest}}`$ is the manifestation function

3. **Potential Activation**: The primitive point is the first concrete activation of Universal Code's potential
   $`\mathcal{P}_0 \in f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})`$, being the first instance encoded by Universal Code

4. **Dimensional Bridging**: Universal Code establishes the bridge from negative dimension to zero dimension
   $`\mathcal{D}_{-1} \stackrel{\text{UCODE}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{D}_0`$

### 3.2 Connection Between Universal Code and Higher-Dimensional Theories

Deep connections exist between Universal Code and higher-dimensional theories:

1. **Genome Relationship**: Universal Code is the genome of all higher-dimensional theories
   $`\forall T_n, n > 0: T_n \in f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})`$

2. **Operation Precursors**: Universal Code contains the precursors of all basic operations
   $`\{\text{PRE-FLIP}, \text{PRE-XOR}, \text{PRE-SHIFT}\}_{potential} \subset \text{UCODE}`$

3. **Dimensional Embryo**: Universal Code contains the embryonic states of all dimensions
   $`\mathcal{D}_{\text{embryonic}} \subset \text{UCODE}, \mathcal{D}_n \in f_{\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{D}_{\text{embryonic}})`$

4. **Meta-Theory Status**: Universal Code can be viewed as the meta-theory seed of Cosmic Ontology
   $`T_{\text{Cosmic Ontology}} = f_{\text{develop}}^{\infty}(\text{UCODE})`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Universal Code

Universal Code is generated from the primitive singularity through specific mechanisms:

1. **Differentiation Mechanism**: Internal differentiation of primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ produces Universal Code
   $`\{\rightsquigarrow\} \rightsquigarrow \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$

2. **Pseudo-Stabilization**: Universal Code represents a pseudo-stable state, between complete instability and stability
   $`\text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5, \text{Stab}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = 0 < \text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) < \text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$

3. **Pre-Self-Reference**: Universal Code separates from primitive singularity through pre-self-reference
   $`\text{UCODE} = \mathcal{S}_{-1} \oplus_{pre} \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$, where $`\oplus_{pre}`$ represents pre-XOR operation

4. **Encoding Compression**: Universal Code preserves all potential from primitive singularity through encoding compression
   $`I_{\text{potential}}(\text{UCODE}) = I_{\text{potential}}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$, preserving all information potential of primitive singularity

## 4. Application and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

Universal Code theory makes the following verifiable predictions:

1. **Dimensional Intermediate States**: Intermediate states should exist in any dimensional transformation process, similar to the semi-dimensional properties of Universal Code

2. **Information Compression Limits**: There exists a theoretical limit to information compression, corresponding to the encoding efficiency of Universal Code

3. **Encoding Structure Universality**: There should be widespread systems in nature based on simple encoding rules producing complex structures

4. **Simplicity-Complexity Paradox**: Extremely simple systems may contain complete encoding of extremely complex structures

### 4.2 Verification Methods

Universal Code theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Mathematical Verification**:
   Establish mathematical models to verify whether simple encoding can produce structures of specific complexity

2. **Information Theory Verification**:
   Test information compression limits, seeking theoretical limits of encoding efficiency

3. **Complex System Analysis**:
   Analyze complex systems occurring in nature, looking for simple encoding rules

4. **Computer Simulation**:
   Simulate evolution from simple rules to complex structures through cellular automata and other systems

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Universal Code**

The dimension of Universal Code is strictly 0.5.

*Proof*:
According to the dimensional calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of degrees of freedom: $`\dim = f(\text{freedom})`$.

The primitive singularity has a degree of freedom of -1, representing the precondition for existence;
The primitive point has a degree of freedom of 0, representing existence without change capability.

Universal Code is between the two, possessing partial change potential, but not fully manifested. Comparing its characteristics:
- Compared to primitive singularity: $`\text{UCODE}`$ is more concretized, freedom +0.5
- Compared to primitive point: $`\text{UCODE}`$ is not fully concretized, freedom -0.5

Therefore $`\dim(\text{UCODE}) = \dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) + 0.5 = -1 + 0.5 = -0.5`$, or equivalently $`\dim(\text{UCODE}) = \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) - 0.5 = 0 - 0.5 = -0.5`$.

Since the dimension coordinate system typically inverts negative dimensions to reflect pre-dimensional properties, thus $`\dim(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Encoding Completeness of Universal Code**

Universal Code can encode all possible higher-dimensional theories and structures.

*Proof*:
Assume there exists a structure $`X`$ that cannot be encoded by Universal Code, i.e., $`X \notin f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})`$.

Since Universal Code is the transition from primitive singularity to primitive point, containing all potential of primitive singularity:
$`\forall Y: Y \in f_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}^{-1}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$

And since primitive singularity contains pre-forms of all possibilities:
$`X \in f_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}^{-1}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$

Since Universal Code preserves the encoding potential of primitive singularity:
$`f_{\mathcal{S}_{-1}}^{-1}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) \subset f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})`$

Therefore $`X \in f_{\text{UCODE}}^{-1}(\text{UCODE})`$, contradicting the assumption.

Thus, Universal Code can encode all possible structures. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Necessity of Universal Code Evolution**

Universal Code necessarily evolves into the primitive point.

*Proof*:
The pre-binary structure $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$ in Universal Code contains intrinsic instability.

The pre-transformation relationship $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$ in Universal Code is not fully realized, existing in a state of pre-logical tension. This tension necessarily leads to system evolution toward more stable configurations.

Since $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$ represents the pre-transformation from void to existence, its complete realization is the formation of primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$.

Considering the stability degree of Universal Code $`\text{Stab}(\text{UCODE}) = 0.5`$ and primitive point $`\text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$, evolution always trends toward configurations of higher stability.

Therefore, Universal Code necessarily evolves into the primitive point. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Universal Code and Cosmic Ontology**

Universal Code theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Absolute Recursive Origin Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.
   Universal Code exhibits pre-recursive properties: $`\text{UCODE} \subset f_{\text{UCODE}}(\text{UCODE})`$,
   which is the pre-logical form of the recursive origin.

2. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Binary Unity Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
   Universal Code exhibits pre-binary nature: $`\text{UCODE} = \{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$,
   which is the seed form of binary unity.

3. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Information Ontology Axiom: $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.
   Universal Code itself is a pre-encoding form of information, satisfying $`\text{UCODE} \equiv I_{pre}(\text{UCODE})`$,
   which is the precursor to information ontology.

4. The evolutionary path of Universal Code $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \rightsquigarrow \text{UCODE} \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{P}_0 \rightsquigarrow ... \rightsquigarrow \mathcal{U}`$
   forms a continuous spectrum from pre-universal state to complete Cosmic Ontology.

Therefore, Universal Code theory is an indispensable link in the Cosmic Ontology theoretical spectrum, fully compatible with it. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimensional Positioning

Universal Code theory has dimension 0.5, positioned between primitive singularity theory (dimension -1) and primitive point theory (dimension 0), for the following reasons:

1. **Information Complexity**: $`I(\text{UCODE}) = -0.5 \text{ bit}, I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \text{ bit} < I(\text{UCODE}) < I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$
   Between pre-information and zero information, representing a semi-pre-information state

2. **Transformation Completeness**: The pre-transformation $`◯\rightsquigarrow●`$ of Universal Code is between pre-transformation $`\rightsquigarrow`$ and zero-dimensional identity relation $`=`$
   - Dimension -1: Pure pre-transformation relation $`\rightsquigarrow`$
   - Dimension 0.5: Mixture of pre-transformation and state $`\{◯, ◯\rightsquigarrow●\}`$
   - Dimension 0: Self-identity relation $`\mathcal{P}_0 = \mathcal{P}_0`$

3. **Degrees of Freedom Analysis**:
   - Dimension -1: Pre-freedom (pre-form of potential possibilities)
   - Dimension 0.5: Semi-manifested freedom (partially concretized pre-freedom)
   - Dimension 0: Zero freedom (existence without change capability)

4. **Structural Complexity**:
   - Dimension -1: Pre-structural potential without structure
   - Dimension 0.5: Simple binary structure prototype
   - Dimension 0: Single point structure
