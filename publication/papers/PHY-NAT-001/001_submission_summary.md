## Next Steps

To complete the final submission:

1. **Review all materials**
   - Check all content for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify figures and mathematical equations
   - Ensure all references are correctly formatted

2. **Run the compilation script**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/publication/papers/PHY-NAT-001
   chmod +x compile_submission.sh
   ./compile_submission.sh
   ```

3. **Verify generated PDFs**
   - Check the compiled PDF files for formatting issues
   - Ensure all equations, figures, and tables appear correctly
   - Verify that all references are correctly linked

4. **Prepare for August 2025 submission**
   - Complete any remaining simulation validations
   - Update experimental results if new data becomes available
   - Conduct final proofreading before submission

## Notes

- The compilation script requires LaTeX, BibTeX, Pandoc, and ZIP utilities
- All files are already in their final form and ready for compilation
- The final submission package will be assembled in `submission_package/final_submission/`
- A complete ZIP archive will be created at `submission_package/PHY-NAT-001_submission.zip`
