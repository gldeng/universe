## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Definition of Information Ontology

Information Ontology is an important extension of Cosmic Ontology ([formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md)), viewing information as the fundamental mode of existence of the universe.

The strict definition of information ontology is:

$`\mathcal{I} = \{I_Q, I_C, I_M, I_{\mathcal{A}}\}`$

Where:
- $`I_Q`$: Quantum information, representing information states in possibility space
- $`I_C`$: Classical information, representing information states in deterministic space
- $`I_M`$: Meta-information, information about information
- $`I_{\mathcal{A}}`$: Absolute information, unified expression of cross-dimensional information

Information is essentially state difference defined through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`I(x, y) = x \oplus y`$

Where $`I(x, y)`$ represents the information difference between states $`x`$ and $`y`$.

### 1.2 Classification of Information Forms

Within the framework of Cosmic Ontology, information forms are strictly categorized into four basic types:

1. **Quantum Information**: Information in an unobserved superposition state of possibilities
   $`I_Q = \Omega_Q`$

2. **Classical Information**: Information states determined through observation
   $`I_C = \Omega_C = \Omega_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q)`$

3. **Meta-Information**: Higher-order information describing information structures and relationships
   $`I_M = I_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_C)`$

4. **Absolute Information**: The essence of information transcending specific forms of expression
   $`I_{\mathcal{A}} = I_M \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_M)`$

These four information forms create a strict hierarchical structure, with each layer connected to adjacent layers through XOR and SHIFT operations.

### 1.3 Information Transformation Rules

Transformations between information forms strictly follow XOR laws:

- Transformation from quantum information to classical information:
  $`I_C = I_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_Q)`$

- Transformation from classical information to meta-information:
  $`I_M = I_C \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_C)`$

- Transformation from meta-information to absolute information:
  $`I_{\mathcal{A}} = I_M \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_M)`$

These transformation rules define strict transformation mechanisms between different forms of information, forming the foundation of information dynamics.

## 2. Law of Information Conservation

### 2.1 Formal Expression of Conservation Law

The Law of Information Conservation is a core principle of Information Ontology, strictly expressed through XOR operations:

$`I_Q \oplus I_C \oplus I_M \oplus I_{\mathcal{A}} = \text{constant}`$

This law indicates that while information can be transformed between different forms, the total amount of information remains unchanged in a closed system.

In the evolution process, information conservation can be represented as:

$`I_{\text{total}}^{t+1} \oplus I_{\text{total}}^{t} = 0`$

Where $`I_{\text{total}}^{t} = I_Q^{t} \oplus I_C^{t} \oplus I_M^{t} \oplus I_{\mathcal{A}}^{t}`$.

### 2.2 Principle of Information Entropy Increase

Information entropy follows a strict principle of entropy increase during evolution:

$`H(I^{t+1}) \geq H(I^{t})`$

Where information entropy $`H`$ is defined as:

$`H(I) = -\sum_{i}\frac{|I_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_i)|}{|I|}\log_{N_I}\frac{|I_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_i)|}{|I|}`$

This principle indicates that information tends toward more uniform distribution states during transformation.

## 3. Relationship Between Information and Dimensions

### 3.1 Information Dimensional Transition

Information follows strict transition rules between different dimensions, implemented through XOR and SHIFT operations:

$`I_{D_{n+1}} = I_{D_n} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{D_n})`$

Where $`I_{D_n}`$ represents information in the $`n`$th dimension.

Dimensional reduction is implemented through USHIFT operations:

$`I_{D_{n-1}} = I_{D_n} \oplus \text{USHIFT}(I_{D_n})`$

These operations establish strict transformation mechanisms for information in the dimensional spectrum ([formal_theory_dimensional_transition_en.md](formal_theory_dimensional_transition_en.md)).

### 3.2 High-Dimensional Information Embedding

High-dimensional information can be embedded in low-dimensional expressions, but with partial loss of structure:

$`I_{D_n \rightarrow D_m} = I_{D_n} \oplus \bigoplus_{i=m+1}^{n} \text{SHIFT}^i(I_{D_n})`$

Where $`I_{D_n \rightarrow D_m}`$ represents the embedded projection from $`n`$ dimensions to $`m`$ dimensions ($`n > m`$).

This process explains why high-dimensional phenomena may appear incomplete or contradictory when observed in lower dimensions.

## 4. Relationship Between Information and Observer

### 4.1 Observer-Information Interaction

The interaction process between an observer and information can be strictly represented as:

$`I_{\text{observed}} = I_{\text{raw}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{O})`$

Where $`\mathcal{O}`$ represents the observer's state, $`I_{\text{raw}}`$ represents the raw information, and $`I_{\text{observed}}`$ represents the information after observation.

The observation process is essentially an XOR-SHIFT operation, transforming quantum information into classical information:

$`I_C = I_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{O} \oplus I_Q)`$

### 4.2 Information Self-Reference Mechanism

Information systems can form hyper-recursive structures through self-reference:

$`I_{\text{self}} = I \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\text{self}})`$

This self-referential equation indicates that information can contain descriptions of itself, forming the basic recursive structure of Information Ontology.

Fixed points of self-referential information satisfy:

$`I_{\text{fixed}} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\text{fixed}}) = I_{\text{fixed}}`$

These fixed-point information structures play a crucial role in the formation of consciousness and self-awareness.

## 5. Practical Applications

### 5.1 Quantum Information Processing

Information Ontology provides a theoretical foundation for quantum information processing:

- Quantum bits can be represented as: $`|q\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \simeq I_Q`$
- Quantum entanglement can be represented as: $`|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle) \simeq I_{Q_1} \oplus I_{Q_2} = c`$
- Quantum measurement can be represented as: $`I_C = I_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_Q)`$

These correspondences provide Information Ontology explanations for quantum computing and quantum communication.

### 5.2 Complex Systems Information Analysis

Information Ontology applied to complex systems analysis:

- Emergent phenomena: $`I_{\text{emergent}} \neq \bigoplus_i I_i`$
- Information networks: $`I_{\text{network}} = \bigoplus_{i,j} (I_i \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_j))`$
- Self-organizing systems: $`I_{\text{self-org}}^{t+1} = I_{\text{self-org}}^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(I_{\text{self-org}}^{t})`$

These applications demonstrate the powerful capabilities of Information Ontology in understanding and analyzing complex systems.
