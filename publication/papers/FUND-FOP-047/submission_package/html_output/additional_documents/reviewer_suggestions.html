<h3 id="recommended-reviewers">Recommended Reviewers</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Frank Wilczek, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
<li>Email: wilczek@mit.edu</li>
<li>Expertise: Nobel Laureate in Physics with extensive work on
fundamental constants and forces. His expertise in quantum field theory
and the relations between mathematical structures and physical reality
makes him well-suited to evaluate our information-theoretic approach to
fundamental constants.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Carlo Rovelli, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Aix-Marseille University</li>
<li>Email: rovelli@cpt.univ-mrs.fr</li>
<li>Expertise: Leading researcher in quantum gravity and foundations of
physics. His work on relational quantum mechanics and information
approaches to physics aligns with our paper’s perspective on constants
emerging from information structures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Doris Wörner, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: ETH Zurich</li>
<li>Email: doris.woerner@phys.ethz.ch</li>
<li>Expertise: Specialist in mathematical physics with focus on physical
constants and dimensional analysis. Her research on the fine structure
constant and its role in quantum electrodynamics is directly relevant to
our paper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sabine Hossenfelder, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies</li>
<li>Email: hossenfelder@fias.uni-frankfurt.de</li>
<li>Expertise: Theoretical physicist with work on the foundations of
physics and philosophy of science. Her critical perspective on
fundamental constants and the mathematical structure of physics would
provide valuable scrutiny.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mark Tegmark, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
<li>Email: tegmark@mit.edu</li>
<li>Expertise: Cosmologist and physicist known for work on mathematical
universe hypothesis. His research on the mathematical nature of reality
parallels our approach to constants as emerging from information
structures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lee Smolin, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</li>
<li>Email: lsmolin@perimeterinstitute.ca</li>
<li>Expertise: Theoretical physicist working on quantum gravity and
foundations of physics. His research on the nature of time and physical
constants would provide valuable perspective on our approach.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reviewers-to-exclude">Reviewers to Exclude</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Roger Penrose, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: University of Oxford</li>
<li>Rationale: While Professor Penrose’s work is highly respected, his
published criticisms of information-based approaches to physical reality
might prevent an unbiased evaluation of our information-theoretic
framework.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brian Greene, Ph.D.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institution: Columbia University</li>
<li>Rationale: Professor Greene’s strong commitment to string theory as
an explanatory framework may conflict with our alternative approach to
understanding fundamental constants.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-comments-for-editor">Additional Comments for
Editor</h3>
<p>The recommended reviewers represent a diverse range of expertise
across theoretical physics, mathematical physics, quantum foundations,
and philosophy of physics. We have suggested researchers who, while not
directly involved in Universe Ontology development, have the necessary
background to evaluate the mathematical rigor and physical significance
of our proposed relationships between fundamental constants.</p>
<p>The reviewers we suggest excluding have published positions that may
create a predisposition against our framework, potentially inhibiting
fair evaluation of the specific mathematical relationships and their
significance presented in this paper.</p>
