## Formal Theory Definition

Multiphoton non-local interference theory describes a special quantum phenomenon in which undetected photons can control the non-local interference behavior of a multiphoton system, and this phenomenon does not depend on quantum entanglement.

### Symbol System

- $\Psi_{mp}$: Multiphoton system wave function
- $\gamma_u$: Undetected photon
- $\mathcal{I}_{nl}$: Non-local interference operator
- $\mathcal{C}_{\gamma}$: Photon control function
- $\Delta\phi$: Phase difference
- $\mathcal{P}(d|s)$: Conditional probability (probability that detection result is d given source state s)

### Axiom Set

1. **Axiom 1**: Multiphoton non-local interference can be controlled by undetected photons without requiring quantum entanglement.
   $\mathcal{I}_{nl}(\Psi_{mp}) = \mathcal{C}_{\gamma_u}(\Psi_{mp})$

2. **Axiom 2**: Phase changes of undetected photons can affect the interference pattern of the entire multiphoton system.
   $\mathcal{I}_{nl}(\Psi_{mp}|\Delta\phi_{\gamma_u}) \neq \mathcal{I}_{nl}(\Psi_{mp}|\Delta\phi_{\gamma_u}')$ when $\Delta\phi_{\gamma_u} \neq \Delta\phi_{\gamma_u}'$

3. **Axiom 3**: In certain observation bases, the system exhibits non-local behavior even when the undetected photon is removed.
   $\exists \mathcal{B} : \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{B}}(d|s,\gamma_u) = \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{B}}(d|s,\neg\gamma_u)$

## Inference System

### Theorem 1: Multiphoton Non-local Interference and Detection Choice Theorem

The non-local interference properties of a multiphoton system can be controlled by choosing to detect or not detect specific photons, forming a quantum control mechanism.

**Proof**:
From Axioms 1 and 2, we can derive:
$$\mathcal{I}_{nl}(\Psi_{mp}|\gamma_u) = \mathcal{F}[\mathcal{C}_{\gamma_u}(\Delta\phi_{\gamma_u}, \Psi_{mp})]$$

Where $\mathcal{F}$ is the interference function mapping. Since changes in $\Delta\phi_{\gamma_u}$ can affect $\mathcal{I}_{nl}$ even when $\gamma_u$ is not detected, this proves that detection choice can control interference properties.

### Theorem 2: Non-entangled Non-locality Theorem

Multiphoton non-local interference phenomena do not need to rely on quantum entanglement but are realized through quantum superposition and path indistinguishability.

**Proof**:
According to Axiom 3, we can construct a system where photons $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, ..., \gamma_n$ and the undetected photon $\gamma_u$ are not entangled, but the system exhibits:
$$\mathcal{P}(d|\Psi_{mp},\gamma_u) \neq \mathcal{P}(d|\Psi_{mp})$$

This indicates that the presence of $\gamma_u$ affects the detection results, despite the absence of entanglement. This influence is achieved through path interference rather than entanglement.

## Theory Applications

1. **Quantum Communication**: Utilizing undetected photons as a control mechanism can lead to the design of new quantum communication protocols with improved security and efficiency.

2. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum logic gates based on multiphoton non-local interference can implement specific quantum computing tasks without relying on difficult-to-maintain quantum entanglement.

3. **Quantum Measurement Theory**: Provides new insights into quantum measurement theory, particularly regarding the impact of observation on quantum systems.

4. **Quantum Foundations Research**: Offers new experimental and theoretical perspectives for understanding quantum non-locality and measurement problems.

## Relationship with Other Theories

- **Quantum Entanglement Theory**: Multiphoton non-local interference theory demonstrates non-local behavior independent of entanglement, challenging traditional understanding of quantum non-locality.

- **Quantum Superposition Principle**: Extends the understanding of quantum superposition, especially in multi-particle systems.

- **Quantum Measurement Theory**: Provides new insights into how quantum measurement affects system behavior.

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Deepens understanding of the wave-particle duality of light, particularly in multiphoton systems.

## Experimental Verification

In a 2023 study published in Nature Communications, scientists used nonlinear crystals and specific optical setups to experimentally verify how undetected photons control multiphoton interference phenomena. The experimental results closely matched theoretical predictions, confirming the validity of multiphoton non-local interference theory.
