## Quantum Physics Observations

### 2023 - Multiphoton Non-local Quantum Interference Controlled by an Undetected Photon

**Phenomenon Description**: Experiments demonstrate that multiphoton systems can exhibit non-local interference that can be controlled by a photon that is never detected, a phenomenon that does not require quantum entanglement.

**Journal Paper**: [Nature Communications (2023) - Multiphoton non-local quantum interference controlled by an undetected photon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37228-y)

**Formal Theory Explanation**: [Multiphoton Nonlocal Interference Theory](formal_theory/formal_theory_multiphoton_nonlocal_interference_en.md) | [Chinese Version](formal_theory/formal_theory_multiphoton_nonlocal_interference.md)

## Materials Science Observations

### 2016 - Low-Temperature Magneto-Morphological Characteristics of Coronene Crystals

**Phenomenon Description**: Coronene molecular crystals exhibit previously unexplained polymorphic transitions and magnetic behavior at low temperatures. Researchers discovered a new β-phase structure that explains anomalous observations of this material over the past 40 years.

**Journal Paper**: [Scientific Reports (2016) - Low temperature magneto-morphological characterisation of coronene and the resolution of previously observed unexplained phenomena](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38696)

## Atmospheric Physics Observations

### 2021 - Mysterious Gamma Rays Produced During Thunderstorms

**Phenomenon Description**: Scientists have observed high-energy gamma-ray flashes produced during thunderstorms. This phenomenon may help solve the long-standing problem of lightning origin. Japanese researchers are conducting a large-scale citizen science project to collect more data.

**Journal Paper**: [Nature (2021) - Mystery gamma rays could help solve age-old lightning puzzle](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00395-3)
