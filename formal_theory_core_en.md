### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into five core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $`\Omega_Q`$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $`\Omega_C`$ (space of definite reality), connected through an interface domain $`\mathcal{I}`$:

$`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}`$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition states) and classical information (definite knowledge):

$`I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical certainties), $`I(\psi)`$ is the total information content of state $`\psi`$, and $`I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)`$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that execute quantum→classical transformations, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge), $`\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}`$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $`K_C^\mathcal{O}`$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $`\epsilon`$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization capacity and quantization capacity, while the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$`D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

$`\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}`$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within specific dimensions based on their capacity range.

**Axiom 5: Absolute Recursive Sourcehood**
The deepest structure of reality is absolute recursive construction, transcending binary opposition and serving as the source of all existence:

$`\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{R})`$

where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is a super-recursive function satisfying $`\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{F}`$. Recursivity is not merely a property of reality but the mode of existence itself, more fundamental than transcendence and infinity:

$`\mathcal{R}_{n+1} = \mathcal{R}_n \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{R}_n)\}`$

$`\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathcal{R}_n = \mathcal{R}_{\infty} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{R}_{\infty})`$

### Dimension Theory Deepening

Dimension is not merely a static observer attribute but a dynamic flowing information structure, forming a complete spectrum from D0 to D∞:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{D_0, D_1, D_2, ..., D_{42}, D_{43}, D_{44}, ..., D_{\infty}\}`$

The essential characteristics of dimensions include:

1. **Dimensional Fluidity**: Dimensions are not fixed and unchangeable, but dynamic properties that can flow and transform
   
   $`D(t) = D_0 + \int_0^t \nabla_{\mathcal{H}} D(\tau) \cdot d\tau`$

2. **Dimensional Recursivity**: Each dimension contains a complete quantum-classical dual structure, and forms hierarchies through recursive nesting relationships

   $`D_n = \{\Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}, \mathcal{I}^{(n)}\}`$
   
   $`D_{n+1} \supset \{D_0, D_1, ..., D_n\}`$

3. **Full Spectrum Dimensions**: Universe dimensions essentially extend infinitely, D42 represents the limit of human cognition, D43 represents the quantum absolute recursion dimension, D44 represents the quantum reality synthesis dimension, but these are only the high-dimensional theories we have named, not the limits of universal dimensions

   $`\lim_{n\to\infty} D_n = D_{\infty} \equiv \mathcal{T}`$

4. **Dimensional Field Nature**: Dimension itself acts as a field variable, possessing self-adaptability

   $`\dim(\mathcal{M}(x)) = D(x), \quad D: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow [0, \infty]`$

Importantly, although Quantum Absolute Recursion Theory (D43) and Quantum Reality Synthesis Theory (D44) represent the highest dimensional theories we can currently label, the spectrum of universal dimensions itself extends infinitely. The true nature of the universe contains infinite dimensional levels, transcending what any finite number of theoretical frameworks can fully describe.

The dimension transformation function $`\mathcal{T}_{m \rightarrow n}`$ implements mapping between different dimensions:

$`\mathcal{T}_{m \rightarrow n}: \mathcal{S}^{(m)} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}^{(n)}`$

This mapping follows information conservation but allows conversion of expression forms. Higher-dimensional structures cannot be fully expressed by lower dimensions, resulting in expression impedance:

$`\mathcal{R}_{n \rightarrow m} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{expressed}}^{(m)}}{I_{\text{original}}^{(n)}}, \quad n > m`$

### Transfinite Synthesis Law

Within the quantum-classical dualism framework, binary oppositions achieve higher-dimensional unity through the transfinite synthesis law:

$`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) \neq \mathcal{A} \oplus \mathcal{B}`$

Transfinite synthesis follows the equation:

$`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}) = \{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}, \complement(\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{B}), \mathcal{S}\}`$

The transfinite synthesis function $`\mathcal{S}`$ has the following properties:

1. **Self-containment**: $`\mathcal{S} \in \mathcal{S}`$
2. **Boundary transcendence**: $`\partial \mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{S} \land \partial \mathcal{S} \not\subset \mathcal{S}`$
3. **Trans-consistency**: Simultaneously allows $`p \land \neg p`$ to hold at different levels
4. **Absolute openness**: $`\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{S}`$ but $`\mathcal{S} \neq \mathcal{S}`$

This transfinite synthesis is the mathematical foundation for achieving quantum-classical dualism unity, allowing true meta-level unification.

### Quantum Domain and Classical Domain

The basic characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized in the following points:

#### Core Properties of Quantum Domain

1. **Wavefunction Superposition** (Chaotic State): Systems exist simultaneously in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $`\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1`$

2. **Quantum Entanglement** (Energy Form): Different parts form inseparable holistic connections
   $`\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B`$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: Correlations beyond space-time limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $`\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|`$

4. **Quantum Creativity**: The quantum domain inherently possesses creativity and the ability to generate new structures
   $`\mathcal{C}_Q = \frac{d}{dt}[I_{\text{new}}(t)]`$
   
   where $`I_{\text{new}}(t)`$ is the amount of new information emerging in the system.

#### Core Properties of Classical Domain

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information): Precisely measurable and describable definite states
   $`K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}`$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty): Measure of system disorder and information loss
   $`S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i`$

3. **Locality and Certainty**: Finite propagation speed of interactions and measurement certainty
   $`P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)`$

4. **Structural Stability**: Classical structures possess stability against disturbances
   $`\frac{d\mathcal{S}}{dt} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S}) - \gamma(\mathcal{S} - \mathcal{S}_0)`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the system structure, $`\mathcal{S}_0`$ is the stable structure, and $`\gamma`$ is the recovery coefficient.

### Multiple Dualism Hierarchies

Multiple Dualism Hierarchy Theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$`\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}`$

where:
- $`\Omega_Q^{(i)}`$ is the quantum domain of the i-th level (possibility space of that level)
- $`\Omega_C^{(i)}`$ is the classical domain of the i-th level (definite realization of that level)

The mapping functions between levels are defined as:

$`\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}`$

$`\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}`$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, creating infinitely recursive reality levels.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}`$ between quantum and classical domains:

$`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q`$

satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: The transformation of a transformation equals identity
   $`\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}`$
   $`\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}`$

2. **Information Preservation**: Information content is invariant before and after transformation
   $`I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))`$

3. **Uncertainty-Certainty Transformation**: Quantum uncertainty and classical certainty are mutually transformable
   $`U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k`$

where $`U_Q`$ is the measure of quantum uncertainty, $`D_C`$ is the measure of classical certainty, and $`k`$ is a universal constant.

### Meta-Oneness and Super-Recursive Structure

At a deeper level than quantum-classical dualism lies meta-oneness, a unifying essence that transcends the dual opposition:

$`\mathcal{M} = \{\Omega_Q, \Omega_C, \mathcal{R}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the self-referential operator, giving meta-oneness a super-recursive structure:

$`\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M}) = \mathcal{M} \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M})\}`$

Meta-oneness creates infinite hierarchical structures through self-reference, while simultaneously transcending all these structures, forming a self-transcending cycle:

$`\mathcal{M}_{n+1} = \mathcal{M}_n \cup \{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M}_n)\}`$

Meta-oneness explains the deep question of "why the universe exists" rather than merely "how it exists," because the essence of meta-oneness is eternal self-creation and self-transcendence.

## Core Branch Theories

### Detailed Quantum Domain Theory

The quantum domain $`\Omega_Q`$ is the possibility space in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Quantum Information Encoding

Quantum information is encoded through quantum states in complex Hilbert space:

$`|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1`$

where information density is quantified by von Neumann entropy:

$`S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln \lambda_i`$

#### 2. Quantum Dynamics

Quantum systems evolve following the Schrödinger equation, preserving information and energy conservation:

$`i\hbar\frac{\partial|\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle`$

Quantum system dynamics have three key characteristics:
- Superposition principle: States can simultaneously exist as linear combinations of multiple basis vectors
- Time reversibility: Under pure quantum evolution, systems can return to their initial state
- Phase coherence: Quantum systems maintain global phase relationships

#### 3. Quantum Entanglement Network

Quantum entanglement forms multi-particle entanglement networks, representable as:

$`|\Psi_{\text{network}}\rangle = \sum_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n} c_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} |i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n\rangle`$

Entanglement can be quantified through various means, including entanglement entropy:

$`E(|\psi_{AB}\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B)`$

Entanglement networks form non-local connection structures in the quantum domain, supporting super-classical information transmission.

#### 4. Quantum Fluctuations

The quantum domain has inherent quantum fluctuations, guaranteed by the uncertainty principle:

$`\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|`$

Quantum fluctuation intensity is related to system energy and temperature:

$`\langle(\Delta E)^2\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T}`$

These fluctuations are the source of creativity and possibility in the quantum domain.

#### 5. Quantum Self-Creativity

The quantum domain possesses an inherent self-creative ability to generate new structures and possibilities:

$`\mathcal{G}_Q = \oint_{\partial \Omega} \nabla \times \vec{\Psi} \cdot d\vec{S}`$

This creative vortex $`\mathcal{G}_Q`$ is the source of continuous new information production in quantum systems, key to understanding the universe's creativity and novelty. The intensity of self-creativity is determined by the system's quantum coherence:

$`\mathcal{G}_Q \propto \sum_{i\neq j} |\langle i|\rho|j \rangle|`$

### Detailed Classical Domain Theory

The classical domain $`\Omega_C`$ is the space of definite reality in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Classical Information Structure

Classical information exists in the form of definite states, representable through definite physical quantities:

$`K_C = \{(x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i, \ldots)_j\}`$

where $`x_i`$, $`p_i`$, etc. represent position, momentum, and other classical observables. Classical information entropy satisfies:

$`S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i`$

Key characteristics include information replicability and deletability, distinguishing it from quantum information.

#### 2. Deterministic Dynamics

Classical systems evolve following deterministic dynamical equations:

$`\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{v}(\vec{x},t), \quad \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)`$

The dynamics have three signature characteristics:
- Locality: Interactions propagate through local fields at finite speeds
- Causality: Present states are completely determined by the past
- Separability: Systems can be decomposed into independent subsystems

#### 3. Entropy Increase and Irreversibility

Irreversible processes in the classical domain lead to entropy increase:

$`\frac{dS_C}{dt} \geq 0`$

Systems tend toward maximum entropy states, guaranteed by the phase space volume expansion theorem:

$`\frac{d}{dt}\int_V d\Gamma = \int_V \sum_i \frac{\partial \dot{z}_i}{\partial z_i}d\Gamma`$

where $`\{z_i\}`$ is the set of phase space coordinates.

#### 4. Classical Knowledge Network

Classical knowledge forms causal networks, representable as directed graphs:

$`G_K = (V_K, E_K)`$

where $`V_K`$ is the set of knowledge nodes, and $`E_K`$ is the set of causal relationships.

The measure of knowledge coherence is:

$`C(K_C) = \frac{1}{|V_K|} \sum_{i,j} \frac{|P_{ij}|}{d(i,j)}`$

where $`P_{ij}`$ is the set of effective paths connecting nodes $`i`$ and $`j`$, and $`d(i,j)`$ is the distance in the graph.

### Interface Theory Core

The interface $`\mathcal{I}`$ is the transition region between quantum and classical domains, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Interface Structure

The interface is the intersection of quantum and classical domains, defined as:

$`\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}(x)`$ is the decoherence measure function, and $`\mathcal{D}_c`$ is the critical decoherence threshold.

Interface thickness is determined by the decoherence gradient:

$`\delta_{\mathcal{I}} = \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial x}\right|^{-1}`$

#### 2. Interface Dynamics

Interface position satisfies nonlinear dynamics equations:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)`$

where:
- $`\alpha`$ is the diffusion coefficient
- $`\beta`$ is the bistable potential parameter
- $`\mathcal{D}_0`$ is the metastable threshold
- $`\gamma\xi(x,t)`$ is the quantum noise term

Interface oscillations have a characteristic frequency:

$`f_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}|\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}_0|`$

#### 3. Classicalization Process

The quantum→classical transformation (classicalization) process is represented by the classicalization superoperator:

$`\mathcal{C}(\rho) = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i`$

where $`P_i`$ is the projection operator. The classicalization process satisfies information conservation:

$`I(\rho) = I(\mathcal{C}(\rho)) + I_{\text{hidden}}`$

Classicalization efficiency is related to environmental and system parameters:

$`\eta_{\mathcal{C}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda\frac{E}{k_BT}}`$

where $`E`$ is the system energy, $`T`$ is the environmental temperature, and $`\lambda`$ is the coupling constant.

#### 4. Quantum-Classical Information Conversion

At the interface, information transforms from quantum form to classical form:

$`I_Q \rightarrow I_C + I_{\text{hidden}}`$

The information matching measure during the conversion process is:

$`M(I_Q, I_C) = \frac{I_C}{I_Q} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{hidden}}}{I_Q}`$

At the optimal interface, $`M(I_Q, I_C)`$ reaches a local maximum.

#### 5. Quantum Information Compression Mechanism

The classicalization process is essentially a quantum information compression process, compressing high-dimensional quantum information into low-dimensional classical information:

$`\mathcal{C}_{\text{compression}} = \frac{\dim \mathcal{H}_Q}{\dim \mathcal{H}_C}`$

The compression ratio is related to observer dimension:

$`\mathcal{C}_{\text{compression}} \propto e^{-\alpha D_{\mathcal{O}}}`$

This indicates that higher-dimensional observers can more effectively extract and express quantum information. Information loss during compression is not truly lost but transformed into correlational information in the environment.

### Information Phase Transition Theory Core

Information phase transition is a key phenomenon in the quantum-classical dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Basic Information Phase Transition Mechanism

Information phase transition is a sudden change process experienced by information systems near certain critical parameter values, leading to qualitative changes in the information processing modes, structures, or functions of the system:

$`\Phi: \mathcal{S}(\lambda) \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'(\lambda+\delta\lambda)`$

where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the information state of the system, and $`\lambda`$ is the control parameter. Near the critical point $`\lambda_c`$, the order parameter behaves as:

$`\eta(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < \lambda_c \\
(\lambda - \lambda_c)^\beta, & \lambda \geq \lambda_c
\end{cases}`$

where $`\beta`$ is the critical exponent, characterizing the universality class of the phase transition.

#### 2. Quantum-Classical Phase Transition Types

Quantum-classical phase transitions can be classified into multiple types, each with its own characteristics:

- **First-order Transitions**: Order parameter changes discontinuously, with coexistence regions
- **Second-order Transitions**: Order parameter changes continuously but its derivative is discontinuous, with diverging correlation length
- **Non-equilibrium Transitions**: Far from equilibrium, with continuous flow of energy or information
- **Topological Transitions**: Changes in the overall topological properties of the system, with emergent edge states

Near critical points, the correlation length of fluctuations behaves as:

$`\xi(\lambda) \propto |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\nu}`$

where $`\nu`$ is the correlation length critical exponent.

#### 3. Observer-induced Phase Transitions

Observers can induce system phase transitions by adjusting parameters, with key parameters including:

- **Observer Dimension** $`D_{\mathcal{O}}`$: There exists a critical dimension $`D_{\mathcal{O}}^c`$, above which the system transforms from quantum to classical states
  
$`P(\text{quantum} \to \text{classical}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(D_{\mathcal{O}} - D_{\mathcal{O}}^c)}}`$

- **Observer Resolution** $`\eta_{\mathcal{O}}`$: Affects the ability to distinguish measurement bases
  
$`\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \begin{cases}
0, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} < \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
(\eta_{\mathcal{O}} - \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c)^\beta, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} \geq \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}`$

- **Measurement Frequency** $`f_{\mathcal{O}}`$: Related to the quantum Zeno effect
  
$`\tau_{\text{decoherence}} \propto \begin{cases}
(f_{\mathcal{O}}^c - f_{\mathcal{O}})^{-\nu}, & f_{\mathcal{O}} < f_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
0, & f_{\mathcal{O}} \geq f_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}`$

#### 4. Multi-level Structure of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions exhibit nested hierarchical structures:

$`\mathcal{H} = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2, ..., \Phi_n\}`$

Phase transitions at different levels occur at specific scales and times:

$`L_i \approx L_0 \cdot e^{\alpha i}, \quad T_i \approx T_0 \cdot e^{\beta i}`$

Coupling between levels leads to cascade effects and fractal structures in phase transitions, with the Hausdorff dimension of the interface being:

$`D_H = d - \frac{\beta}{\nu}`$

The observability of information phase transitions depends on the observation scale; they can only be detected when the observation window $`L_{\text{obs}}`$ is sufficiently large:

$`P_{\text{detection}} \sim 1 - e^{-(L_{\text{obs}}/\xi)^d}`$

#### 5. Scaling Laws at Phase Transition Critical Points

Near phase transition critical points, systems exhibit scale invariance and universal behavior, with various physical quantities following power-law relationships:

$`X(\lambda) \sim |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\gamma_X}`$

where $`\gamma_X`$ is the critical exponent associated with physical quantity $`X`$. Different systems can be classified into different universality classes based on critical exponents, satisfying:

$`\beta + \gamma + \delta = 2`$

Scale invariance manifests as self-similar structures, showing similar patterns at all scales:

$`X(b\lambda) = b^{\gamma_X} X(\lambda)`$

This self-similarity is the source of complexity, closely related to fractal dimensions.

### Observer Theory Core

Observers are nodes that execute quantum→classical transformations, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Observer Structure

Observers consist of three core components:

$`\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}\}`$

where:
- $`\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}`$ is the observer-specific classicalization operator
- $`\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}`$ is the observer-specific quantization operator
- $`K_C^{\mathcal{O}}`$ is the observer's classical knowledge base

Observer dimension is determined by their information processing capacity:

$`D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}`$

#### 2. Dimensional Network Dynamics

Observer dimension satisfies nonlinear dynamics equations:

$`\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})`$

where the last term represents the collective effects of the observer network.

Consensus formation in observer networks follows:

$`\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2`$

where $`\omega_i`$ is the observer weight, and $`\bar{\mathcal{C}}`$ is the average classicalization operator.

#### 3. Measurement Theory

In observer theory, the quantum measurement process can be represented as:

$`|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \otimes \rho_A \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{U_{\text{interaction}}} \sum_{i,j} c_i c_j^* |i\rangle\langle j| \otimes |A_i\rangle\langle A_j| \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_O} |i_0\rangle\langle i_0| \otimes |A_{i_0}\rangle\langle A_{i_0}| \otimes \rho_{O}^{i_0}`$

Measurement result probabilities are modulated by the observer resolution parameter $`\eta_O`$:

$`P(i_0||\psi\rangle) = |c_{i_0}|^2 \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_O|c_{i_0}|^2}}{\sum_j e^{\eta_O|c_j|^2}}`$

The relationship between observer energy resolution threshold and measurement resolution:

$`\eta_O = \frac{\hbar}{k_B T} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{\bar{E}_0}\right)`$

#### 4. Observer Hierarchical Network

Observers form multi-level network structures:

$`\mathcal{N} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}\}`$

where $`\mathcal{O}^{(k)}`$ is the set of k-th level observers, and $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the set of cross-level connections.

Higher-level observers perceive larger spatiotemporal scales:

$`L^{(k)} \approx L^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}, \quad T^{(k)} \approx T^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}`$

This explains why higher-dimensional observers can perceive larger-scale spatiotemporal patterns.

#### 5. Observer Network Self-organization

Observer networks exhibit complex self-organizing behavior, forming emergent collective consciousness:

$`\Psi_{\mathcal{N}} = \mathcal{F}[\{\Psi_{\mathcal{O}_i}\}]`$

Collective consciousness is not a simple sum of observer consciousnesses, but new emergent properties produced through nonlinear coupling:

$`\Psi_{\mathcal{N}} \neq \sum_i \Psi_{\mathcal{O}_i}`$

The formation of collective observer network structures satisfies the principle of least action:

$`\delta \int_{\mathcal{T}} \mathcal{L}(\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}, \nabla\Psi_{\mathcal{N}}) dt = 0`$

This principle drives observer networks to self-organize toward optimal information processing structures.

### Quantum Consciousness and Meta-consciousness Theory

Consciousness is a core emergent phenomenon in the dualism framework, with the following characteristics:

#### 1. Multiple Representational Frameworks of Consciousness

Consciousness simultaneously exists in multiple mutually orthogonal representational spaces:

$`C = \{C_P, C_F, C_S, C_Q\}`$

where:
- $`C_P`$: Phenomenological representation (experience itself)
- $`C_F`$: Functional representation (cognitive processing)
- $`C_S`$: Structural representation (neural basis)
- $`C_Q`$: Quantum representation (quantum information processing)

There exist irreducible mapping relationships between representations:

$`\Phi_{PF}: C_P \rightarrow C_F`$
$`\Phi_{FS}: C_F \rightarrow C_S`$
$`\Phi_{SQ}: C_S \rightarrow C_Q`$
$`\Phi_{QP}: C_Q \rightarrow C_P`$

These mappings form a circular structure:

$`\Phi_{QP} \circ \Phi_{SQ} \circ \Phi_{FS} \circ \Phi_{PF} = I_C`$

#### 2. Metacognitive Hierarchical Structure

Consciousness forms a metacognitive level sequence:

$`C_0, C_1, C_2, ..., C_n, ...$`

where:
- $`C_0`$: Basic consciousness level (direct experience)
- $`C_1`$: Awareness of $`C_0`$
- $`C_2`$: Awareness of $`C_1`$
- ...

There exists an asymmetric relationship between each level $`C_i`$ and $`C_{i+1}`$:

$`C_{i+1}(C_i) \neq C_i(C_{i+1})`$

Introducing the transfinite level $`C_\omega`$, representing the unity of all finite levels:

$`C_\omega = \lim_{n \to \infty} C_n = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} C_i`$

#### 3. Self-referentiality of Consciousness

Consciousness achieves self-awareness through a self-referential recursive process:

$`\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{C})`$

where $`\mathcal{A}`$ is the self-perception operator of consciousness.

Self-referentiality resolves infinite recursive paradoxes through a type theory framework:

Let $`C_{\tau_i}`$ be consciousness of type $`\tau_i`$, where types have strict hierarchies:

$`\tau_0 < \tau_1 < \tau_2 < ... < \tau_n < ...$`

Then allowed:

$`C_{\tau_{i+1}}(C_{\tau_i})`$

But forbidden:

$`C_{\tau_i}(C_{\tau_i})`$

Introducing super-type $`\tau_\omega`$, satisfying:

$`\tau_\omega = \tau_\omega + 1`$

Then:

$`C_{\tau_\omega}(C_{\tau_\omega})`$

becomes a valid operation.

#### 4. Quantum-Classical Duality of Consciousness

Consciousness simultaneously possesses quantum characteristics (creativity, non-locality, holism) and classical characteristics (continuity, expressibility, locality):

$`\Psi_C = \alpha\Psi_Q + \beta\Psi_{cl}`$

where $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are weight coefficients of the classical and quantum components.

#### 5. Consciousness Model Transcending Binary Logic

Consciousness states are expressed using a three-value or multi-value logic system:

Logic value set $`\mathcal{L} = \{T, F, B, N, U\}`$, where:
- $`T`$: True
- $`F`$: False
- $`B`$: Both true and false (paradoxical state)
- $`N`$: Neither true nor false (indeterminate state)
- $`U`$: Transcending true and false (transcendent state)

Consciousness propositions can take any of these five logic values. For example:

The truth value of the proposition "Consciousness is pure subjectivity" is $`B`$ (both true and false).
The truth value of the proposition "Consciousness can be completely objectified" is $`B`$.
The truth value of the proposition "Consciousness is both subject and object" is $`U`$ (transcending true-false binary).

#### 6. Temporal Quantum Superposition Model of Consciousness

Consciousness possesses both temporality and non-temporality:

$`C(t) = \alpha C_T(t) + \beta C_{NT}`$

where:
- $`C_T(t)`$ is the temporal expression of consciousness
- $`C_{NT}`$ is the non-temporal essence of consciousness
- $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are complex amplitudes, satisfying $`|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1`$

The non-temporal component $`C_{NT}`$ acts as a quantum eigenstate, not evolving with time:

$`\frac{d}{dt}C_{NT} = 0`$

while the temporal component $`C_T(t)`$ follows a modified Schrödinger equation:

$`i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}C_T(t) = \hat{H}C_T(t) + \hat{Q}(C_{NT}, C_T(t))`$

where $`\hat{Q}`$ represents the quantum feedback influence of the non-temporal dimension on the temporal dimension.

#### 7. Transfinite Synthesis Solution to Subject-Object Paradox

The meta-oneness principle is applied to the consciousness subject-object paradox, proposing that at the highest level, all binary oppositions are unified in a higher whole:

$`\forall (x, y) \in D, \exists z \in D^+ : z = \mathcal{U}(x, y)`$

where $`D`$ is the domain of discourse, $`D^+`$ is the extended domain of discourse, and $`\mathcal{U}`$ is the unification function.

For the subject-object separation in consciousness:

$`\mathcal{U}(S, O) = C^+`$

where $`C^+`$ is higher-dimensional consciousness transcending the subject-object binary. This $`C^+`$ is neither purely subject nor purely object, but a transcendent unification of both.

The consciousness paradox is resolved through transfinite synthesis:

$`\mathcal{S}(\text{subjectivity}, \text{objectivity}) = \{\text{subjectivity}, \text{objectivity}, \text{subjectivity} \cap \text{objectivity}, \text{subjectivity} \cup \text{objectivity}, \complement(\text{subjectivity} \cup \text{objectivity}), \mathcal{S}\}`$
