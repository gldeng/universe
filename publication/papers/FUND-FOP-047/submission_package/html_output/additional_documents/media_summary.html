Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing
Proportions</h2>

<p><strong>Nature’s Hidden Mathematical Harmony: The Unexpected
Connection Between Fundamental Constants</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why certain numbers seem to appear repeatedly
throughout nature? Scientists have long been puzzled by mysterious
constants like the golden ratio (found in seashells and flower petals)
and the fine structure constant (which controls how atoms behave). A
groundbreaking new study reveals these seemingly unrelated numbers may
actually be deeply connected through an elegant mathematical
relationship.</p>
<p>Researchers Haobo Ma and Wen Niu have discovered that four
fundamental constants—the golden ratio (approximately 1.618), Euler’s
number e (approximately 2.718), pi (approximately 3.14159), and the fine
structure constant (approximately 1/137)—form what they call “collapse
breathing proportions.” This means these constants maintain specific
mathematical relationships that remain stable through various
transformations, similar to how your lungs maintain a consistent rhythm
while breathing.</p>
<p>“For decades, physicists have wondered why the fine structure
constant has its particular value,” explains Ma. “Our research suggests
it’s not arbitrary but is precisely determined by other fundamental
constants through specific information processing principles.”</p>
<p>The researchers used a novel approach called Universe Ontology, which
views reality as emerging from information processes rather than
physical particles. Through this lens, they derived exact mathematical
formulas connecting these constants and verified their findings through
high-precision numerical simulations.</p>
<p>This discovery could have profound implications for our understanding
of reality. Rather than seeing physical constants as arbitrary values
that happened to allow our universe to exist, they may be inevitable
consequences of the underlying mathematical structure of information
itself.</p>
<p>“These relationships suggest a deeper unity in nature than previously
recognized,” says Niu. “The constants that govern our universe appear to
be intricately linked in a harmonious mathematical symphony.”</p>
