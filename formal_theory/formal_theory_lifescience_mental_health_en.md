## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Axiom System

**Axiom 1: Multi-level Life-Psychological Integration Axiom**
There exists a hierarchically integrated life-psychological space $`\mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$, representable as:

$`\mathcal{B}\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{B} \otimes \mathcal{P}`$

where $`\mathcal{B}`$ represents the biological level space, and $`\mathcal{P}`$ represents the psychological level space.

**Axiom 2: Life-Psychological Dynamic Evolution Axiom**
The integrated system state $`\psi^t \in \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$ evolves according to XOR-SHIFT dynamics:

$`\psi^{t+1} = \psi^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\psi^t \oplus \Omega^t)`$

where $`\Omega^t`$ represents the combined influence of internal and external factors.

**Axiom 3: Health Steady State Region Axiom**
There exists a multidimensional health steady state region $`\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P}`$, defined as:

$`\mathcal{H} = \{\psi \in \mathcal{B}\mathcal{P} | \Phi_B(\psi) \leq \theta_B \land \Phi_P(\psi) \leq \theta_P \land \Phi_{BP}(\psi) \leq \theta_{BP}\}`$

### 1.2 Strict Definitions

**Definition 1: Integrated Health Index**
The Integrated Health Index $`\text{IHI}(\psi)`$ is defined as:

$`\text{IHI}(\psi) = \alpha \cdot \text{BHI}(\psi_B) + \beta \cdot \text{MHI}(\psi_P) + \gamma \cdot \text{BPI}(\psi_B, \psi_P)`$

**Definition 2: Bio-Psychological Resilience**
Bio-Psychological Resilience $`\mathcal{R}_{BP}(\psi)`$ is defined as the system's integrated recovery capacity in response to perturbations.

**Definition 3: Integrated Intervention Operator**
The Integrated Intervention Operator $`\mathcal{I}_{BP}`$ is defined as a transformation that simultaneously acts on the biological and psychological dimensions.

### 1.3 Direct Inferences

**Inference 1: Bio-Psychological Feedback Loop**
There exists a bidirectional causal feedback between biological and psychological states.

**Inference 2: Bio-Psychological Markers of Critical State Transitions**
As a system approaches a critical transition, it simultaneously displays biological and psychological warning signals.

**Inference 3: Integrated Intervention Synergistic Effects**
Interventions targeting both biological and psychological dimensions simultaneously produce superadditive effects.

## 2. Extended Theory

### 2.1 Systems Biology and Mental Health Integration

Systems biology principles can be extended to include the psychological dimension, forming a bio-psychological network $`\mathcal{N}_{BP}`$.

### 2.2 Life-Psychological Spatiotemporal Dynamics

Biological-psychological states evolve across multiple spatiotemporal scales and can be analyzed through wavelet transformations.

### 2.3 Individualized Precision Health Model

Personalized health trajectory prediction based on individual-specific bio-psychological parameters $`\theta_i`$.

## 3. Applications and Validation

### 3.1 Clinical Applications

**Integrated Disease Classification**:
A multidimensional disease space based on bio-psychological phenotypes.

**Integrated Treatment Strategies**:
Multi-modal interventions designed based on bio-psychological network structure.

### 3.2 Experimental Validation

This theory can be validated through longitudinal cohort studies, intervention trials, and integration of multi-omics with psychometrics.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Ontological Significance

This theory transcends mind-body dualism, proposing a unified ontological perspective on biological and psychological phenomena.

### 5.2 Epistemological Insights

From an epistemological standpoint, this theory points out that when studying biological or psychological phenomena, one must consider the entire bio-psychological system.

### 5.3 Methodological Guidance

Methodologically, this theory advocates simultaneously collecting and analyzing biological and psychological data, developing cross-scale models, and designing integrated interventions.
