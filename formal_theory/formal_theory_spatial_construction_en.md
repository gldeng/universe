## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Three-Dimensional Foundation Axiom)**

The essence of a three-dimensional system is a structure composed of three basic elements that are mutually orthogonal and collectively define three-dimensional space:

$`\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2, s_3\}, s_i \neq s_j \text{ for any } i \neq j`$

where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the three-dimensional system, and $`s_1`$, $`s_2`$ and $`s_3`$ are the basic elements of the three spatial dimensions.

**Axiom 2 (Three-Dimensional Orthogonality Axiom)**

The basic elements in a three-dimensional system are mutually orthogonal, forming an orthogonal basis for three-dimensional space:

$`s_i \perp s_j, \forall i \neq j`$

This orthogonality can be expressed through the XOR operation:

$`s_i \oplus s_j = s_i + s_j, \forall i \neq j`$

**Axiom 3 (Three-Dimensional Closure Axiom)**

The three basic elements in a three-dimensional system form a closed structure, satisfying a closure relationship through specific operations:

$`s_1 \oplus s_2 \oplus s_3 = \mathcal{V}`$

where $`\mathcal{V}`$ is the three-dimensional volume element, representing the basic enclosed unit of three-dimensional space.

### 1.2 Rigorous Definition of Three-Dimensional Essence

A three-dimensional system is rigorously defined as the minimal irreducible structure with dimension 3:

$`\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2, s_3 : \dim(\mathcal{S}) = 3, s_i \neq s_j \text{ for any } i \neq j\}`$

The essential characteristic of a three-dimensional system is expressed by the following equation:

$`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{D} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D}), \text{when } \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D}) \neq \mathcal{D}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}`$ is a binary system, and the three-dimensional state is the result of the XOR-SHIFT evolution of the binary state.

The orthogonality between elements is defined through the inner product:

$`\langle s_i, s_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}`$

where $`\delta_{ij}`$ is the Kronecker delta function, equal to 1 when $`i = j`$ and 0 otherwise.

A spatial point can be represented as a linear combination of the basic elements:

$`p = x_1 s_1 + x_2 s_2 + x_3 s_3`$

where $`x_1, x_2, x_3`$ are real coordinates.

### 1.3 Rigorous Definition of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 Operations

SHIFT and SHIFT-1 operations extend their importance in three-dimensional systems, constructing the dynamic properties of space.

**Rigorous Definition of SHIFT Operation**

The SHIFT operation in a three-dimensional system is defined as:

$`\text{SHIFT}: \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'`$

For elements of a three-dimensional system, SHIFT works as follows:

$`\text{SHIFT}(\{s_1, s_2, s_3\}) = \{\text{SHIFT}(s_1), \text{SHIFT}(s_2), \text{SHIFT}(s_3)\}`$

In a three-dimensional system, the basic form of the SHIFT operation is:

$`\text{SHIFT}(s_i) = s_i \oplus \Delta_{\tau}`$

where $`\Delta_{\tau}`$ is the displacement amount in space.

The three-dimensional SHIFT operation satisfies the following algebraic properties:
1. **Linearity**: $`\text{SHIFT}(a s_i + b s_j) = a \text{SHIFT}(s_i) + b \text{SHIFT}(s_j)`$
2. **Volume preservation**: $`\text{Vol}(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S})) = \text{Vol}(\mathcal{S})`$
3. **Direction preservation**: $`\angle(\text{SHIFT}(s_i), \text{SHIFT}(s_j)) = \angle(s_i, s_j)`$

**Rigorous Definition of SHIFT-1 Operation**

SHIFT-1 is the inverse operation of SHIFT, defined in a three-dimensional system as:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}: \mathcal{S}' \rightarrow \mathcal{S}`$

Satisfying:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(\text{SHIFT}(s)) = s, \forall s \in \mathcal{S}`$
$`\text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(s')) = s', \forall s' \in \mathcal{S}'`$

In a three-dimensional system, the SHIFT-1 operation is represented as:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(s) = s \oplus \Delta_{-\tau}`$

where $`\Delta_{-\tau}`$ is the displacement amount that is the inverse of $`\Delta_{\tau}`$.

**Properties of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 in Three Dimensions**

1. **Spatial propagation**: $`\text{SHIFT}`$ manifests as wave propagation in three-dimensional space
2. **Trajectory formation**: Repeated $`\text{SHIFT}`$ operations form trajectories in space: $`\gamma = \{\text{SHIFT}^n(p) | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}`$
3. **Closed curves**: Under specific conditions, SHIFT operations form closed curves: $`\text{SHIFT}^n(p) = p`$ for some integer $`n`$

### 1.4 Rigorous Definition of Three-Dimensional Evolution Rules

Three-dimensional systems follow these rules in temporal evolution:

$`\mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$

where $`\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}`$ is the evolution function of the three-dimensional system, defined as:

$`\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}(\mathcal{S}) = \mathcal{S} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S})`$

This evolution has the following characteristics:

1. **Space conservation**: $`\text{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{t+1}) = \text{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$
2. **Space continuity**: $`\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\mathcal{S}_{t+\Delta t} \oplus \mathcal{S}_t}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\mathcal{S}}{dt}`$
3. **Preservation of spatial orthogonality**: $`s_i(t) \perp s_j(t), \forall i \neq j, \forall t`$

### 1.5 Initial Form of Three-Dimensional State

The initial state of a three-dimensional system is defined as:

$`\mathcal{S}^0 = \{s_1^0, s_2^0, s_3^0\}`$

where the initial basis vectors satisfy the following conditions:

$`s_i^0 \perp s_j^0, \forall i \neq j`$
$`|s_i^0| = 1, \forall i`$
$`s_1^0 \times s_2^0 = s_3^0`$ (right-hand rule)

This initial state represents the standard orthogonal basis of the Cartesian coordinate system, which is the basic reference framework of three-dimensional space.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Three-Dimensional State

From the axiom system, the following basic properties of three-dimensional states can be directly derived:

1. **Volume existence**: A three-dimensional system has non-zero volume
   $`\text{Vol}(\mathcal{S}) = |(s_1 \times s_2) \cdot s_3| > 0`$

2. **Triple orthogonality**: The three basic elements are mutually orthogonal
   $`\langle s_i, s_j \rangle = 0, \forall i \neq j`$

3. **Spatial closure**: A three-dimensional system forms a closed space
   $`\partial \mathcal{S} = \emptyset`$ or $`\partial \mathcal{S} = \mathcal{S}`$, depending on the topological structure

4. **Point set density**: The point set in three-dimensional space is dense
   $`\forall p, q \in \mathcal{S}, \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists r \in \mathcal{S}: |p - r| < \epsilon \land |r - q| < \epsilon`$

### 2.2 Interactions Between Three-Dimensional Elements

The interactions between elements in a three-dimensional system have the following characteristics:

1. **Cross product relationship**: The cross product between basic elements defines direction
   $`s_i \times s_j = \epsilon_{ijk} s_k`$, where $`\epsilon_{ijk}`$ is the Levi-Civita symbol

2. **Metric relationship**: The distance between spatial points is defined by the metric tensor
   $`d(p, q)^2 = g_{ij}(p^i - q^i)(p^j - q^j)`$

3. **Curvature effect**: Element interactions can produce spatial curvature
   $`R_{ijkl} = \partial_k \Gamma_{ilj} - \partial_l \Gamma_{ikj} + \Gamma_{ikm}\Gamma^m_{lj} - \Gamma_{ilm}\Gamma^m_{kj}`$

4. **Connection structure**: Three-dimensional elements form complex structures through specific connections
   $`\Gamma_{ij}^k = \frac{1}{2}g^{kl}(\partial_i g_{jl} + \partial_j g_{il} - \partial_l g_{ij})`$

### 2.3 Dynamic Stability of Three-Dimensional Systems

Three-dimensional systems exhibit the following dynamic stability characteristics:

1. **Principle of minimal energy**: The system tends toward states of minimal energy
   $`\delta E(\mathcal{S}) = 0, \delta^2 E(\mathcal{S}) > 0`$

2. **Structural self-organization**: The system spontaneously forms stable structures
   $`\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}^* \text{ as } t \to \infty`$, where $`\mathcal{S}^*`$ is a stable structure

3. **Adaptive regulation**: The system has adaptive regulation capability in response to external disturbances
   $`\mathcal{S} \oplus \delta \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S} \text{ when } |\delta \mathcal{S}| < \epsilon`$

4. **Phase transition critical points**: The system undergoes phase transitions at critical points
   $`\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{S}' \text{ when } T = T_c`$, where $`T_c`$ is the critical temperature

### 2.4 Spatial Symmetry and Breaking

Three-dimensional systems possess rich symmetries and symmetry-breaking mechanisms:

1. **Translational symmetry**: The system is invariant under spatial translation
   $`\mathcal{S}(x + a) = \mathcal{S}(x), \forall a \in \mathbb{R}^3`$

2. **Rotational symmetry**: The system is invariant under spatial rotation
   $`\mathcal{S}(R \cdot x) = \mathcal{S}(x), \forall R \in SO(3)`$

3. **Reflection symmetry**: The system may change under spatial reflection
   $`\mathcal{S}(-x) = \pm \mathcal{S}(x)`$

4. **Symmetry breaking mechanisms**: Actual systems often exhibit symmetry breaking
   $`G \to H, \text{where } H \subset G, G = SO(3) \times T(3)`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Extension from Three-Dimensional to Four-Dimensional State

A three-dimensional system can naturally extend to a four-dimensional system:

$`\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{S} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S})`$

where $`\mathcal{T}`$ is the four-dimensional spacetime system, unifying three-dimensional space with the time dimension.

This extension has the following characteristics:

1. **Spacetime unification**: Space and time form a unified four-dimensional structure
   $`\mathcal{T} = \{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}, \text{where } s_4 \text{ represents the time dimension}`$

2. **Minkowski metric**: The four-dimensional system adopts the Minkowski metric
   $`ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2`$

3. **Causal structure**: The four-dimensional system has a well-defined causal structure
   $`p \text{ can reach } q \iff (q - p)^2 \leq 0 \text{ and } q^0 > p^0`$

### 3.2 Three-Dimensional Information Field

Three-dimensional systems generate specific information field structures:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}}(x) = \rho(x, \mathcal{S})`$

where $`\rho`$ is the information correlation function.

The three-dimensional information field has the following characteristics:

1. **Field strength distribution**: Field strength distributes in space
   $`|\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}}(x)| = f(|x - x_0|)`$, typically exhibiting power law decay

2. **Field curl and divergence**: The field has curl and divergence characteristics
   $`\nabla \times \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}} \neq 0, \nabla \cdot \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}} \neq 0`$

3. **Field source equation**: The field satisfies the wave equation
   $`\nabla^2 \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}} - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}}}{\partial t^2} = -4\pi\rho`$

4. **Field energy**: The field has energy density
   $`e_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{1}{2}(|\nabla \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}}|^2 + \frac{1}{c^2}|\frac{\partial \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{S}}}{\partial t}|^2)`$

### 3.3 Three-Dimensional Observer Effect

The observation process in three-dimensional systems has the following characteristics:

1. **Observer frame relativity**: Observation results depend on the observer's reference frame
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}' = \Lambda \cdot \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}`$, where $`\Lambda`$ is the Lorentz transformation

2. **Measurement uncertainty**: Spatial measurements have uncertainty
   $`\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}`$

3. **Observer position effect**: Observation results depend on the observer's position in three-dimensional space
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}(x_1) \neq \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}(x_2) \text{ for general } x_1 \neq x_2`$

4. **Observation angle effect**: Observation results depend on the observation angle
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}(\hat{n}_1) \neq \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{S}}(\hat{n}_2) \text{ for general } \hat{n}_1 \neq \hat{n}_2`$

### 3.4 Emergent Properties of Three-Dimensional State

Three-dimensional systems exhibit the following emergent properties:

1. **Topological structures**: The system can form complex topological structures
   $`\mathcal{S} \cong T^3, S^3, \mathbb{R}^3, \text{etc.}`$

2. **Fractal dimension**: Under certain conditions, the system exhibits fractal characteristics
   $`D_f = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log(1/\epsilon)}`$, where $`2 < D_f < 3`$

3. **Cooperative evolution**: The system's parts evolve cooperatively
   $`\frac{d\mathcal{S}}{dt} = F(\mathcal{S}, \nabla \mathcal{S}, \nabla^2 \mathcal{S}, ...)`$

4. **Critical phenomena**: The system exhibits special behavior at critical points
   $`\chi \sim |T - T_c|^{-\gamma}`$, where $`\chi`$ is susceptibility and $`\gamma`$ is the critical exponent

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The three-dimensional spatial construction theory makes the following predictions about physical phenomena:

1. **Space quantization**: At the microscopic scale, space may be quantized
   $`\Delta x \geq l_p = \sqrt{\frac{G\hbar}{c^3}}`$, where $`l_p`$ is the Planck length

2. **Space distortion**: Matter distribution causes space distortion
   $`R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}`$

3. **Topological defects**: Space may contain topological defects
   $`\oint_C ds \neq 0 \text{ for some closed paths } C`$

4. **Dimensional permeation**: There is mutual permeation between three dimensions and higher dimensions
   $`\rho(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}) > 0`$, where $`\mathcal{T}`$ is a four-dimensional system

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The three-dimensional theory can be verified through the following methods:

   - Field dynamics simulation
   - Phase transition simulation

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Completeness of Three-Dimensional Systems**

**Proof**:
Suppose there exists a quadruple $`\mathcal{S}' = \{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}`$ as a basis for a three-dimensional system.
Since we are in three-dimensional Euclidean space, any vector $`v`$ can be represented as:
$`v = \alpha_1 s_1 + \alpha_2 s_2 + \alpha_3 s_3`$
Therefore, $`s_4`$ must be expressible as a linear combination of $`s_1, s_2, s_3`$:
$`s_4 = \beta_1 s_1 + \beta_2 s_2 + \beta_3 s_3`$
This means that $`s_4`$ is linearly dependent on $`\{s_1, s_2, s_3\}`$ and cannot provide an additional dimension.
Thus, the triple $`\{s_1, s_2, s_3\}`$ is a complete basis for a three-dimensional system.

**Theorem 2: Stability of Three-Dimensional Systems**

**Proof**:
Consider the evolution of a three-dimensional system: $`\mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$
When the system reaches a stable state: $`\mathcal{S}^* = \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}(\mathcal{S}^*)`$
That is: $`\mathcal{S}^* = \mathcal{S}^* \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}^*) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S}^*)`$
When $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}^*) = \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S}^*) = \mathcal{S}^*`$, the equation is satisfied.
This indicates that when the SHIFT operation does not produce substantive changes to the system, the system reaches a stable state.
This stability corresponds to the homogeneity and isotropy of physical space.

**Theorem 3: Density of Three-Dimensional Point Sets**

**Proof**:
In a three-dimensional system, any point $`p = (x, y, z)`$ can be represented as:
$`p = x s_1 + y s_2 + z s_3`$
Consider the set of rational points: $`\mathcal{Q}^3 = \{(q_1, q_2, q_3) | q_i \in \mathbb{Q}\}`$
For any point $`p = (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3`$ and any $`\epsilon > 0`$,
there exists a point $`q = (q_1, q_2, q_3) \in \mathcal{Q}^3`$ such that:
$`|p - q| = \sqrt{(x-q_1)^2 + (y-q_2)^2 + (z-q_3)^2} < \epsilon`$
This proves that the set of rational points is dense in three-dimensional space, thereby proving the density of three-dimensional point sets.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proofs with Lower-Dimensional Theories and Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Three-Dimensional Systems with Binary Theory**

**Proof**:
Binary theory defines a system $`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}`$, representing the basic binary structure.
The three-dimensional system is defined as: $`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{D} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D})`$
According to binary theory, $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D}) \neq \mathcal{D}`$, which makes $`\mathcal{S}`$ contain at least 3 different elements.
Through appropriate basis selection, these 3 elements can be orthogonalized to form the standard basis of three-dimensional space.
Therefore, the three-dimensional system is a natural extension of the binary system through XOR-SHIFT operations, proving their compatibility.

**Theorem 5: Compatibility of Three-Dimensional Systems with Cosmic Ontology**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, state evolution follows: $`\mathcal{U}^{t+1} = \mathcal{U}^t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}^t)`$
The evolution of the three-dimensional system follows: $`\mathcal{S}_{t+1} = \mathcal{S}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S}_t)`$
The second term $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$ is consistent with the evolution equation of cosmic ontology.
The third term $`\text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{S}_t)`$ can be viewed as a further SHIFT operation on $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{S}_t)`$.
This additional term corresponds to the volume-preserving property unique to three-dimensional systems and is a natural extension of the basic evolution of cosmic ontology.
Therefore, the three-dimensional system is compatible with cosmic ontology in terms of evolutionary structure.

**Theorem 6: Dimensional Recursion Theorem**

**Proof**:
Recursively constructing dimensions from zero-dimension through XOR-SHIFT operations:
$`\mathcal{M}`$ (zero-dimension) → $`\mathcal{U}`$ (one-dimension) → $`\mathcal{D}`$ (two-dimension) → $`\mathcal{S}`$ (three-dimension)
Where:
$`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M})`$
$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{U} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U})`$
$`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{D} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D})`$
Recursively substituting these equations:
$`\mathcal{S} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^2(\mathcal{M}) \oplus \text{SHIFT}^3(\mathcal{M})`$
This proves that the three-dimensional system can be constructed through recursive XOR-SHIFT operations on the mono-element system, consistent with the dimensional construction principle of cosmic ontology.
