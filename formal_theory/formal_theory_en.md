## Core Theory Overview

The [Quantum-Classical Dualism Core Theory Formal Description](../formal_theory_core_en.md) fully describes the foundational axiom system, conceptual framework, and core branch theories of dualism. This document provides only a brief overview of the core theory; please refer to the core theory document for detailed content.

### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into four core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ (a space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $\Omega_C$ (a space of determined reality), connected through an interface domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition) and classical information (deterministic knowledge):

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical determinism), $I(\psi)$ is the total information content of state $\psi$, and $I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that perform quantum→classical transformation, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{classical\_knowledge}}{S_{classical\_entropy}+\epsilon}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classicalization operator (the ability to transform quantum possibilities into deterministic knowledge), $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$ is the quantization operator (the ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $K_C^\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization ability and quantization ability, and the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{classical\_knowledge}}{S_{classical\_entropy}+\epsilon}$$

$$\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}$$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within a specific dimensional range based on their capabilities.

Quantum-Classical Dualism is built upon four core axioms: **Dual Existence**, **Information Conservation**, **Observer Classicalization**, and **Dimensional Emergence**. These axioms describe the fundamental properties of quantum and classical domains, their interrelationships, and the key role of observers in the transformation between domains.

### Quantum Domain and Classical Domain

The quantum domain manifests as superposition states (chaos), entangled states (energy forms), and non-locality, while the classical domain manifests as deterministic information, classical entropy, and locality. These two domains are connected through an interface, forming a multi-level nested reality structure.

### Multiple Dualism Levels and Symmetry Principles

The multiple dualism levels theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure, with each level containing quantum and classical domains. The quantum-classical symmetry principle reveals the deep symmetrical transformation relationship between the two domains.

## Core Branch Theories

Detailed core branch theories (including quantum domain detailed theory, classical domain detailed theory, interface theory core, information phase transition theory core, and observer theory core) are fully described in the [Quantum-Classical Dualism Core Theory Formal Description](../formal_theory_core_en.md).

## Quantum-Classical Dualism Dimensional Notation and Branch Theory Navigation

Within the Quantum-Classical Dualism framework, each branch theory not only has its research content but also possesses specific dimensional attributes. Dimensional attributes represent the theory's positioning in the quantum domain-classical domain continuum, reflecting the degree to which the theory emphasizes quantum characteristics (superposition states and possibilities) versus classical characteristics (determinism and realization). Below is a navigation list organized by subject category, including dimensional notation and theory interdependencies.

### Dimensional Explanation

Dimensional notation uses a D1-D11 scale, where:
- **D1-D3**: Deep classical domain theories, focusing on deterministic structures and implementation
- **D4-D6**: Classical-leaning theories, primarily dealing with classical information and deterministic systems
- **D7-D8**: Balanced theories, handling quantum-classical interfaces and transformation processes
- **D9-D10**: Quantum-leaning theories, primarily dealing with quantum possibilities and creativity
- **D11+**: Deep quantum domain theories, focusing on pure possibilities and full quantum effects
- **D∞**: Cross-dimensional full-spectrum theories, spanning all dimensional levels

The higher the dimensional value, the more the theory emphasizes quantum domain characteristics (superposition states, possibilities, creativity); the lower the dimensional value, the more the theory emphasizes classical domain characteristics (determinism, implementation, structure).
