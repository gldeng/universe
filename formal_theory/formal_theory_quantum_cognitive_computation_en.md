## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Axiomatic System

**Axiom 1 (Quantum Cognitive Ground State Axiom)**

The fundamental state of a cognitive system is a quantum state, representable as a state vector in Hilbert space:

$`|\psi_c\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i |\phi_i\rangle`$

where $`|\phi_i\rangle`$ are cognitive basis states, $`\alpha_i`$ are complex amplitudes, satisfying $`\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1`$.

**Axiom 2 (Cognitive Operator Axiom)**

Cognitive processes correspond to Hermitian operators in Hilbert space:

$`\hat{C} = \sum_{j} \lambda_j |c_j\rangle \langle c_j|`$

where $`\lambda_j`$ are eigenvalues of the cognitive operator, and $`|c_j\rangle`$ are the corresponding eigenvectors representing possible cognitive states.

**Axiom 3 (Cognitive Measurement Axiom)**

The cognitive decision process is equivalent to quantum measurement, collapsing from multiple possibilities to a specific outcome:

$`P(c_j) = |\langle c_j|\psi_c\rangle|^2`$

where $`P(c_j)`$ is the probability of the cognitive system selecting state $`|c_j\rangle`$.

**Axiom 4 (Cognitive Evolution Axiom)**

The evolution of cognitive states follows the unitary transformations of quantum mechanics:

$`|\psi_c(t)\rangle = e^{-i\hat{H}_ct/\hbar}|\psi_c(0)\rangle`$

where $`\hat{H}_c`$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the cognitive system, controlling the system's dynamic evolution.

### 1.2 Mathematical Representation of Quantum Cognitive States

The state space of a cognitive system is defined as:

$`\mathcal{H}_C = \mathcal{H}_P \otimes \mathcal{H}_E \otimes \mathcal{H}_M`$

where:
- $`\mathcal{H}_P`$ is the perception space
- $`\mathcal{H}_E`$ is the emotion space
- $`\mathcal{H}_M`$ is the memory space

A composite cognitive state can be represented as:

$`|\Psi_C\rangle = \sum_{i,j,k} \lambda_{ijk} |p_i\rangle \otimes |e_j\rangle \otimes |m_k\rangle`$

where $`|p_i\rangle`$, $`|e_j\rangle`$, and $`|m_k\rangle`$ are perception, emotion, and memory basis states, respectively.

The cognitive density matrix is defined as:

$`\rho_C = |\Psi_C\rangle\langle\Psi_C| = \sum_{i,j,k,l,m,n} \lambda_{ijk}\lambda_{lmn}^* |p_i\rangle\langle p_l| \otimes |e_j\rangle\langle e_m| \otimes |m_k\rangle\langle m_n|`$

When the cognitive system is in a mixed state, the density matrix can be represented as:

$`\rho_C = \sum_{\alpha} p_{\alpha}|\Psi_C^{\alpha}\rangle\langle\Psi_C^{\alpha}|`$

where $`p_{\alpha}`$ is the probability of the system being in state $`|\Psi_C^{\alpha}\rangle`$.

### 1.3 Evolution Dynamics of Cognitive Wave Functions

The evolution of cognitive wave functions follows a modified Schrödinger equation:

$`i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Psi_C(t)\rangle = \hat{H}_C|\Psi_C(t)\rangle + \hat{F}(|\Psi_C(t)\rangle)`$

where $`\hat{H}_C`$ is the cognitive Hamiltonian operator:

$`\hat{H}_C = \hat{H}_P + \hat{H}_E + \hat{H}_M + \hat{H}_{PE} + \hat{H}_{PM} + \hat{H}_{EM}`$

Each term represents perception, emotion, memory, and their interactions, respectively.

The non-linear term $`\hat{F}(|\Psi_C(t)\rangle)`$ represents non-Hermitian feedback processes, describing attention allocation and conscious monitoring:

$`\hat{F}(|\Psi_C(t)\rangle) = \gamma\big(\langle\Psi_C(t)|\hat{A}|\Psi_C(t)\rangle\big)\hat{B}|\Psi_C(t)\rangle`$

where $`\hat{A}`$ is the attention operator, $`\hat{B}`$ is the feedback regulation operator, and $`\gamma`$ is a non-linear coupling function.

For open cognitive systems, the evolution can be described by the Lindblad master equation:

$`\frac{d\rho_C}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[\hat{H}_C, \rho_C] + \sum_j \left(L_j\rho_C L_j^{\dagger} - \frac{1}{2}\{L_j^{\dagger}L_j, \rho_C\}\right)`$

where $`L_j`$ are jump operators describing interactions with the environment.

### 1.4 Basic Principles and Assumptions

**Principle 1: Cognitive Superposition Principle**

A cognitive system can simultaneously exist in a superposition of multiple possible cognitive states until a measurement (decision) occurs.

**Principle 2: Cognitive Entanglement Principle**

Cognitive subsystems (such as memory and emotion) can form entangled states that cannot be decomposed into independent substates:

$`|\Psi_{EM}\rangle \neq |\Psi_E\rangle \otimes |\Psi_M\rangle`$

**Principle 3: Cognitive Interference Principle**

Interference can occur between cognitive paths, leading to non-classical distributions of cognitive probabilities:

$`P(a\lor b) \neq P(a) + P(b)`$, when $`a`$ and $`b`$ are mutually exclusive cognitive options.

**Principle 4: Cognitive Complementarity Principle**

Certain cognitive attributes (such as precise emotional state and precise logical reasoning) cannot be measured precisely simultaneously, satisfying an uncertainty relation:

$`\Delta E \cdot \Delta L \geq \frac{1}{2}\hbar_c`$

where $`\Delta E`$ and $`\Delta L`$ are the standard deviations of emotional and logical attributes, respectively, and $`\hbar_c`$ is a cognitive constant.

## 2. Quantum Cognitive Operations and Transformations

### 2.1 Quantum Superposition of Cognitive States

Cognitive superposition states represent the simultaneous consideration of multiple possibilities during thinking:

$`|\psi_{\text{thinking}}\rangle = \alpha_1|option A\rangle + \alpha_2|option B\rangle + ... + \alpha_n|option N\rangle`$

The superposition weights $`\alpha_i`$ are influenced by subjective preferences, prior beliefs, and emotional states:

$`\alpha_i = f(B_i, E_i, P_i)`$

where $`B_i`$ are prior beliefs, $`E_i`$ are emotional evaluations, and $`P_i`$ is the perceptual salience of options.

The superposition construction operator is defined as:

$`\hat{S} = \sum_i w_i|i\rangle\langle 0|`$

which transforms the initial cognitive state $`|0\rangle`$ into a superposition state, where $`w_i`$ are cognitive weight coefficients.

### 2.2 Cognitive Entanglement and Non-locality

Cognitive entangled states represent inseparable cognitive associations:

$`|\Psi_{AB}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|A_1\rangle|B_1\rangle + |A_2\rangle|B_2\rangle)`$

Entanglement can be measured through von Neumann entropy:

$`E(\rho_{AB}) = S(\rho_A) = -\text{Tr}(\rho_A\log\rho_A)`$

where $`\rho_A = \text{Tr}_B(\rho_{AB})`$ is the reduced density matrix of subsystem A.

Cognitive Bell inequalities can be used to detect genuine cognitive entanglement:

$`|\langle C_1 C_2\rangle + \langle C_1 C_2'\rangle + \langle C_1' C_2\rangle - \langle C_1' C_2'\rangle| \leq 2`$

Exceeding this bound indicates the presence of non-local cognitive correlations.

### 2.3 Cognitive Collapse and Decision Formation

The decision process is represented as measurement collapse of cognitive states:

$`|\psi_{\text{post-decision}}\rangle = \frac{\hat{P}_j|\psi_{\text{pre-decision}}\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle\psi_{\text{pre-decision}}|\hat{P}_j|\psi_{\text{pre-decision}}\rangle}}`$

where $`\hat{P}_j = |j\rangle\langle j|`$ is the projection operator.

Collapse probabilities are determined by Born's rule:

$`P(j) = |\langle j|\psi_{\text{pre-decision}}\rangle|^2`$

Multi-stage decision processes are represented as sequences of consecutive projections:

$`|\psi_{\text{final}}\rangle = \frac{\hat{P}_n\hat{P}_{n-1}...\hat{P}_1|\psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle\psi_{\text{initial}}|\hat{P}_1^{\dagger}...\hat{P}_n^{\dagger}\hat{P}_n...\hat{P}_1|\psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle}}`$

### 2.4 Quantum Cognitive Interference Effects

Cognitive path interference is represented as amplitude addition:

$`\langle \phi|\psi_{\text{combined}}\rangle = \langle\phi|\psi_{\text{path1}}\rangle + \langle\phi|\psi_{\text{path2}}\rangle + ... + \langle\phi|\psi_{\text{pathn}}\rangle`$

Interference intensity depends on the phase relationships between paths:

$`I = |\langle\phi|\psi_{\text{combined}}\rangle|^2 = \sum_{j,k} \langle\phi|\psi_{\text{pathj}}\rangle\langle\psi_{\text{pathk}}|\phi\rangle`$

Mathematical expression for the cognitive double-slit experiment:

$`P(x) = |A_1e^{i\phi_1} + A_2e^{i\phi_2}|^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2A_1A_2\cos(\phi_1 - \phi_2)`$

where $`A_1`$ and $`A_2`$ are the amplitudes of the two cognitive paths, and $`\phi_1`$ and $`\phi_2`$ are the corresponding phases.

## 3. Cognitive Computation Models

### 3.2 Quantum Cognitive Turing Machines

A quantum cognitive Turing machine is defined as a septuple:

$`\mathcal{QCTM} = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_a, q_r)`$

where:
- $`Q`$ is the set of quantum cognitive states
- $`\Sigma`$ is the input alphabet
- $`\Gamma`$ is the tape alphabet
- $`\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{C}^{Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R,N\}}`$ is the quantum transition function
- $`q_0, q_a, q_r`$ are the initial, accepting, and rejecting states, respectively

Quantum transition amplitudes satisfy:

$`\sum_{q', \gamma', d} |\delta(q, \gamma, q', \gamma', d)|^2 = 1, \forall q \in Q, \gamma \in \Gamma`$

The cognitive state of the machine is represented as:

$`|\psi_{\text{QCTM}}\rangle = \sum_{q,x,i} \alpha_{q,x,i} |q\rangle |x\rangle |i\rangle`$

where $`\rho_i`$ are subsystem states, and $`|i\rangle`$ are addresses in the global workspace.

Self-collapse equation for consciousness state vectors:

$`\frac{d|\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}\rangle}{dt} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}|\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}\rangle - \gamma\left(\langle\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}|\hat{O}|\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}\rangle - \langle\hat{O}\rangle_t\right)^2|\Psi_{\text{consciousness}}\rangle`$

where the second term represents non-linear collapse due to self-observation.
