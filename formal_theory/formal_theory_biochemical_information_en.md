## Core Theory Overview

Biochemical Information and Dualism extends the quantum-classical dualism framework to biomolecular information systems, revealing the quantum-classical dual mechanisms of information processing in living systems. This theory proposes that biological molecules (such as DNA, RNA, and proteins) carry both classical information (base sequences, amino acid sequences) and exhibit quantum information properties (electron transfer, proton tunneling, quantum effects in molecular recognition). Life processes are essentially continuous quantum-classical information conversions, where key life activities such as gene expression, protein folding, and enzymatic catalysis can be more deeply understood through the quantum-classical dual information framework.

## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Formal Definition of Biochemical Information Systems

A biochemical information system $`\mathcal{B}`$ can be formally defined as:

$`
\mathcal{B} = (\mathcal{B}_Q, \mathcal{B}_C, \mathcal{I}_B, \mathcal{E})
`$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{B}_Q`$ is the quantum domain of the biological system (molecular orbitals, electron transfer, quantum tunneling)
- $`\mathcal{B}_C`$ is the classical domain of the biological system (molecular structures, sequence information, metabolic networks)
- $`\mathcal{I}_B`$ is the biological quantum-classical interface
- $`\mathcal{E}`$ is the biological environment

### Core Axioms of Biochemical Information

**Axiom 1: Biological Information Duality**
Biomolecular information simultaneously possesses quantum and classical fundamental forms:

$`
\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{B}_Q \diamond \mathcal{B}_C
`$

Where $`\diamond`$ represents the biological quantum-classical information connection operation.

**Axiom 2: Biomolecular Quantum Superposition Principle**
Biomolecules exist in superposition states of multiple conformations and reaction pathways at the microscopic level:

$`
|\Psi_B\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |S_i\rangle
`$

Where $`|S_i\rangle`$ are molecular state basis vectors, and $`\alpha_i`$ are complex amplitudes.

**Axiom 3: Biological Information Classicalization Principle**
Biological function expression is the process of quantum states classicalizing into determinate biological effects:

$`
\rho_B = \mathcal{M}(|\Psi_B\rangle\langle\Psi_B|)
`$

Where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the biological environment-induced classicalization process, and $`\rho_B`$ is the density matrix of classicalized biological effects.

## Biomolecular Information Processing Mechanisms

Biomolecular information processing involves dynamic conversion between quantum and classical information, described by the following equation:

$`
\mathcal{I}(B) = \mathcal{I}_Q(B) + \mathcal{I}_C(B) - \mathcal{I}_{QC}(B)
`$

Where $`\mathcal{I}(B)`$ is total biological information, $`\mathcal{I}_Q(B)`$ is quantum biological information, $`\mathcal{I}_C(B)`$ is classical biological information, and $`\mathcal{I}_{QC}(B)`$ is quantum-classical information overlap.

DNA replication, transcription, and translation processes can be formalized as:

$`
\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{I}_{DNA} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_{RNA} \rightarrow \mathcal{I}_{Protein}
`$

Where each step contains quantum-classical information conversion:

$`
\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}_Q \circ \mathcal{T}_C
`$

## Quantum-Classical Duality of DNA and RNA

DNA and RNA molecules exhibit significant quantum-classical duality:

1. **Quantum Domain Properties**:
   - Quantum tunneling effects in base pair electron cloud overlap and hydrogen bonds
   - Electron transfer and charge migration in DNA
   - Quantum effects in base stacking interactions

2. **Classical Domain Properties**:
   - Determinate base sequences and molecular structures
   - Classical chemical bonds and nucleic acid backbone
   - Deterministic genetic information encoded in sequences

The DNA classicalization process can be represented as:

$`
\rho_{DNA} = \sum_i p_i |DNA_i\rangle\langle DNA_i|
`$

Where classicalization probabilities are related to environmental parameters:

$`
p_i = f(T, pH, [ions], \mathcal{E}_{bio})
`$

## Information Dynamics of Protein Folding

Protein folding is a typical quantum-classical information conversion process, described by the following information entropy equation:

$`
S_{folding} = S_{initial} - \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \mathcal{I}_{QC}(t) dt
`$

Where $`\mathcal{I}_{QC}(t)`$ is the quantum-classical information flow during the folding process, expressed as:

$`
\mathcal{I}_{QC}(t) = \eta \cdot \text{Tr}[\rho_Q(t) \ln \rho_C(t)]
`$

$`\eta`$ is the quantum-classical coupling coefficient.

## Entropy and Information in Biological Systems

Biological systems counteract entropy increase by maintaining quantum-classical information dynamic equilibrium:

$`
\Delta S_{bio} + \Delta \mathcal{I}_{bio} \geq 0
`$

Where information gain comes from quantum-classical synergistic effects:

$`
\Delta \mathcal{I}_{bio} = \alpha \Delta \mathcal{I}_Q + \beta \Delta \mathcal{I}_C + \gamma \Delta \mathcal{I}_{QC}
`$

$`\alpha`$, $`\beta`$, and $`\gamma`$ are weighting coefficients.

## Applications and Experimental Verification

This theory can be applied to the following fields:

1. **Biomolecular Computing**: Designing new biological computing systems utilizing the quantum-classical information properties of DNA and proteins
2. **Drug Design**: Optimizing drug binding based on the quantum-classical properties of target molecules
3. **Biosensors**: Developing high-sensitivity sensing systems that leverage quantum effects in biomolecules
4. **Disease Diagnosis**: Discovering early disease markers by detecting deviations in biomolecular quantum-classical information

Experimental verification methods include:
- Quantum biological spectroscopy measurements of electron transfer in biomolecules
- Single-molecule mechanical experiments to detect quantum-classical transitions in protein folding
- Ultrafast spectroscopy techniques to probe quantum tunneling effects in DNA base pairs
