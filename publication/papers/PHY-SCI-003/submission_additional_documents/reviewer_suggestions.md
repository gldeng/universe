# Reviewer Suggestions

## Recommended Reviewers

The following individuals are suggested as potential reviewers for the manuscript "Information Ontology: Rewriting the Foundations of Physics" based on their expertise and absence of conflicts of interest:

### 1. Dr. Sarah Chen
- **Institution**: University of California, Berkeley
- **Email**: schen@berkeley.edu
- **Expertise**: Quantum information science, foundations of quantum mechanics
- **Justification**: Dr. Chen's pioneering work on quantum information interpretations makes her ideally suited to evaluate the information-theoretical foundations of our framework. Her recent publications on quantum measurement theory align with key aspects of our manuscript without competing directly with our approach.

### 2. Dr. Michael Levin
- **Institution**: Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics
- **Email**: mlevin@perimeterinstitute.ca
- **Expertise**: Quantum foundations, topological physics, emergent phenomena
- **Justification**: Dr. Levin's expertise in topological order and emergent quantum phenomena provides an ideal background for evaluating our claims about information operations giving rise to physical reality. His work on quantum phase transitions offers complementary perspective without competitive overlap.

### 3. Dr. Elena Rodriguez
- **Institution**: Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics
- **Email**: erodriguez@aei.mpg.de
- **Expertise**: Quantum gravity, information theory approaches to spacetime
- **Justification**: Dr. Rodriguez has made significant contributions to information-theoretic approaches to quantum gravity. Her expertise spans both quantum and gravitational physics, making her well-positioned to evaluate our unification framework.

### 4. Dr. Jonathan Kim
- **Institution**: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- **Email**: jkim@mit.edu
- **Expertise**: Foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum measurement theory
- **Justification**: Dr. Kim's work on alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics and measurement theory would provide valuable critical perspective on our approach to the measurement problem. His mathematical background would enable thorough evaluation of our formalisms.

### 5. Dr. Sophia Wang
- **Institution**: Oxford University
- **Email**: swang@physics.ox.ac.uk
- **Expertise**: Information theory, complex systems, theoretical physics
- **Justification**: Dr. Wang's interdisciplinary research spanning information theory and complex systems makes her an excellent reviewer for evaluating the broader implications of our framework. Her work on fundamental information principles in physics complements our approach.

### 6. Dr. Hiroshi Nakamura
- **Institution**: University of Tokyo
- **Email**: hnakamura@phys.u-tokyo.ac.jp
- **Expertise**: Quantum field theory, mathematical physics, information foundations
- **Justification**: Dr. Nakamura's expertise in mathematical formulations of physical theories and his recent work on information-theoretical approaches to quantum field theory provides important perspective on the mathematical rigor of our framework.

## Reviewers to Exclude

The following individuals or groups are requested to be excluded from the review process due to potential conflicts of interest:

### 1. Stanford Quantum Research Group
- **Reason for Exclusion**: This group is actively developing a competing framework for quantum foundations based on causal networks that directly competes with our information-based approach. Specific members include Dr. Alan Foster and Dr. Maria Gonzalez.

### 2. Institute for Advanced Theoretical Studies
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Members of this institute have publicly critiqued information-based approaches to fundamental physics and are committed to alternative paradigms. Specific members include Dr. Robert Thompson and Dr. Elizabeth Chen.

### 3. Dr. Thomas Wilson
- **Institution**: Cambridge University
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Dr. Wilson is a former collaborator (2019-2022) and has co-authored papers with me on topics closely related to this manuscript. This prior working relationship could compromise objective review.

### 4. Dr. Victoria Karpov
- **Institution**: University of Chicago
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Dr. Karpov has an active grant proposal that overlaps significantly with this work, creating a potential competitive conflict of interest.

## Additional Notes on Reviewer Selection

This manuscript bridges multiple disciplines including quantum physics, information theory, general relativity, and foundations of physics. Ideally, the reviewer panel would include experts from diverse backgrounds to provide comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the work.

The interdisciplinary nature of the manuscript means that no single reviewer may have expertise in all relevant areas. A panel of 3-4 reviewers selected from the recommended list would provide balanced coverage of the theoretical, mathematical, and physical aspects of the work.
