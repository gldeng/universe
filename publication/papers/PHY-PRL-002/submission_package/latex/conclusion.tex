We have presented four specific, experimentally testable predictions derived from the Universe Ontology theoretical framework. These predictions, centered around the concept of Quantum XOR Causal Invariance, offer concrete opportunities to validate or falsify key aspects of the theory. The proposed experimental protocols are feasible with current technology, providing a practical path toward empirical assessment of this novel theoretical approach to unifying quantum and classical physics.

Should these predictions be experimentally confirmed, they would provide strong evidence for the role of fundamental information operations in the structure of physical reality, potentially opening new avenues for understanding quantum phenomena and advancing quantum technologies.
