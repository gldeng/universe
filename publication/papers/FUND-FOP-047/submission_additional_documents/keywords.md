## Golden Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing Proportions

### Primary Keywords

1. Fine Structure Constant
2. Golden Ratio
3. Universe Ontology
4. Information Theory
5. FLIP-XOR-SHIFT Operations

### Alternative Keywords (if needed)

- Mathematical Constants
- Quantum Information
- Dimensionless Constants
- Physical Constants
- Information Field Theory

### Keyword Selection Rationale

These keywords were selected to maximize discoverability across physics, mathematics, and information science fields. They include both specific technical terms (Fine Structure Constant, Golden Ratio, FLIP-XOR-SHIFT) and broader conceptual frameworks (Universe Ontology, Information Theory) to ensure the paper reaches the intended interdisciplinary audience.

The primary keywords directly reflect the core subject matter of the paper, while the alternative keywords provide additional context and potential search terms that researchers in related fields might use.
