## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Mono-Paradigm Unity Axiom)**

The essence of a mono-paradigm system is a single whole, wherein all internal differences are different manifestations of the same source:

$`\mathcal{U} = \{U\}`$

where $`\mathcal{U}`$ is the mono-paradigm system, and $`U`$ is the unified whole that contains everything.

**Axiom 2 (Mono-Paradigm Inclusion Axiom)**

The mono-paradigm system internally contains all possible structures and transformations, but these do not disrupt the system's unity:

$`\forall t \in \mathcal{T}, t(U) \subset U`$

where $`\mathcal{T}`$ is any possible set of transformations.

**Axiom 3 (Mono-Paradigm Self-Sufficiency Axiom)**

The mono-paradigm system is completely self-sufficient, not dependent on external elements; its existence and evolution are completely determined by internal relations:

$`\mathcal{R}(U, U) = U`$

This indicates that the system's self-relation is equivalent to the system itself, embodying complete self-sufficiency.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Mono-Paradigm Essence

The mono-paradigm system is strictly defined as a self-contained whole, with a dimension of 1* (indicating a holistic dimension that transcends simple one-dimensionality):

$`\mathcal{U} = \{U : \dim(U) = 1^*, U = \Omega\}`$

where $`\Omega`$ represents the total domain, and $`1^*`$ represents the holistic dimension.

The essential characteristic of the mono-paradigm system is expressed through the following equation:

$`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{U} \circledast \mathcal{U}`$

where $`\circledast`$ is the holistic self-mapping operation, different from the XOR operation in mono-element theory.

Internal differences are manifested through different facets of self-mapping:

$`\Delta_{\text{internal}}(U_1, U_2) = \|\Pi_1(U) - \Pi_2(U)\| > 0`$

where $`\Pi_i`$ are different projection operators, $`U_1 = \Pi_1(U)`$, and $`U_2 = \Pi_2(U)`$.

### 1.3 Manifestation of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 Operations in Mono-Paradigm System

In the mono-paradigm system, SHIFT and SHIFT-1 operations manifest as internal rearrangements and perspective transformations rather than external displacements.

**Strict Definition of Mono-Paradigm SHIFT Operation**

$`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}: U \rightarrow U'`$

where $`U' \subset U`$ and $`U \subset U'`$, embodying self-containment.

The mono-paradigm SHIFT operation is internally expressed as:

$`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}(U) = \Phi(U)`$

where $`\Phi`$ is an internal self-transformation function, satisfying:

$`\Phi(U) \circledast \Phi^{-1}(U) = U`$

**Strict Definition of Mono-Paradigm SHIFT-1 Operation**

$`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}^{-1}: U' \rightarrow U`$

Satisfying:

$`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}^{-1}(\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}(U)) = U`$

**Composite Properties of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 Operations**

1. **Internal Cyclicity**: $`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}^n(U) = U`$ for some positive integer $`n`$
2. **Perspective Relativity**: Differences between any two SHIFT transformations are merely differences in observational perspective
3. **Whole Preservation**: All SHIFT operations preserve the whole unchanged, only altering internal structure

Unlike in mono-element and dual-element theories, SHIFT operations in mono-paradigm theory do not produce new external elements but reorganize the internal structure of the existing whole.

### 1.4 Strict Definition of Mono-Paradigm Evolution Rules

The mono-paradigm system follows inherent unified rules in temporal evolution:

$`\mathcal{U}_{t+1} = \Psi(\mathcal{U}_t)`$

where $`\Psi`$ is the holistic evolution function:

$`\Psi(U) = U \circledast \text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}(U)`$

This process can be further represented as:

$`U_{t+1} = U_t \circledast \Phi(U_t)`$

Holistic evolution follows these principles:
1. **Self-Consistency**: $`U_{t+1} \equiv U_t`$ from a holistic perspective
2. **Internal Change**: $`\Pi(U_{t+1}) \neq \Pi(U_t)`$ from a local projection perspective
3. **Cyclic Properties**: $`\exists p > 0: U_{t+p} \cong U_t`$ internal structures exhibit periodicity

### 1.5 Initial Form of Mono-Paradigm State

From a holistic perspective, the mono-paradigm system does not have a true "initial state" because it is always complete and self-sufficient. However, to interface with other theories, we can define a reference state:

$`\mathcal{U}^{\text{reference}} = \{U^{\text{reference}}\}`$

where $`U^{\text{reference}}`$ satisfies:

$`U^{\text{reference}} \circledast \text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}(U^{\text{reference}}) = U^{\text{reference}}`$

This reference state is a fixed point of self-mapping, representing the self-stable structure of the mono-paradigm system.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Mono-Paradigm State

From the axiom system, the basic properties of the mono-paradigm state can be directly inferred:

1. **Holistic Unity**: The system exists as a single whole
   $`|\mathcal{U}| = 1, U = \Omega`$, where $`\Omega`$ is the total domain

2. **Internal Differentiation**: The whole contains rich differential structures internally
   $`\exists \Pi_i, \Pi_j: \Pi_i(U) \neq \Pi_j(U)`$, where $`\Pi`$ is a projection function

3. **Self-Reference**: The system can completely reflect itself
   $`U \circledast U = U`$, embodying complete self-reference

4. **Transcendence of Duality**: The system as a whole transcends simple binary classification
   $`\forall A, B: A \sqcup B = U \Rightarrow A \sqcap B \neq \emptyset`$

### 2.2 Mono-Paradigm Self-Reference and Internal Structure

The self-referential structure within the mono-paradigm system manifests as:

1. **Internal Hierarchy**: The whole contains multiple layers of self-referential structures
   $`U^{(n+1)} = U^{(n)} \circledast U^{(n)}`$

2. **Self-Similarity**: Parts contain miniatures of the whole
   $`\Pi_i(U) \sim U`$, exhibiting fractal properties

3. **Holographic Nature**: Each part contains information about the whole
   $`I(\Pi_i(U)) = I(U)`$, where $`I`$ is the information function

4. **Infinite Divisibility**: Internal structures can be infinitely subdivided
   $`\forall \Pi(U), \exists \Pi_1, \Pi_2: \Pi(U) = \Pi_1(U) \cup \Pi_2(U)`$

### 2.3 Dynamic Consistency of Mono-Paradigm System

The mono-paradigm system exhibits inherent dynamic consistency, manifested in the following aspects:

1. **Holistic Invariance**: The system as a whole remains unchanged
   $`\mathcal{U}_{t+1} \equiv \mathcal{U}_t`$

2. **Internal Dynamics**: Internal structures constantly change
   $`\Pi_i(U_{t+1}) \neq \Pi_i(U_t)`$

3. **Self-Organization**: Internal structures spontaneously organize into new patterns
   $`\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \Pi_i(U_t) = \Pi_i^*`$, forming stable internal patterns

4. **Coherent Evolution**: All internal changes develop in coordination
   $`\frac{d\Pi_i(U)}{dt} = \mathcal{F}(\Pi_j(U))`$, all projections are interconnected

### 2.4 Inherent Diversity

The inherent diversity of the mono-paradigm system includes:

1. **Perspective Diversity**: Different perspectives reveal different structures
   $`\mathcal{V}_i(U) \neq \mathcal{V}_j(U)`$, where $`\mathcal{V}`$ is an observation function

2. **Structural Multi-layeredness**: Internally contains multi-level structures
   $`U = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} U^{(i)}`$, with levels nested within each other

3. **Pattern Richness**: Internally can form infinitely many patterns
   $`|\{\Pi_i(U) : \Pi_i \in \mathcal{P}\}| = \infty`$

4. **Complex Network**: Internally forms a complex relationship network
   $`G_U = (V_U, E_U), |V_U| = \infty, |E_U| = \infty`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Internal Transformation from Mono-Paradigm to Dual-Element State

The mono-paradigm state can form a dual structure through internal perspective differentiation:

$`\mathcal{D}_{\text{internal}} = \{\Pi_1(U), \Pi_2(U)\}, \Pi_1(U) \cap \Pi_2(U) = \emptyset, \Pi_1(U) \cup \Pi_2(U) = U`$

This transformation is not an actual division but a dualization of the observational perspective:

$`\mathcal{D}_{\text{internal}} \subset \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{D}_{\text{internal}} \circledast \mathcal{D}_{\text{internal}} = \mathcal{U}`$

Unlike in dual-element theory, duality in mono-paradigm theory is a temporary cognitive structure rather than an ontological separation:

$`\Pi_1(U) \circledast \Pi_2(U) = U`$

### 3.2 Mono-Paradigm Holistic Field

The holistic field produced by the mono-paradigm system can be strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}}(x) = \rho(x, U)`$

where $`\rho`$ is the correlation density function, satisfying:

$`\int_{\Omega} \rho(x, U) dx = 1`$

This holistic field has the following properties:

1. **Global Non-Zero Nature**: The field has non-zero value at every point
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}}(x) > 0, \forall x \in \Omega`$

2. **Holistic Consistency**: The overall structure of the field maintains consistency
   $`\nabla \cdot \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}} = 0`$

3. **Non-Local Correlation**: Different parts of the field are non-locally correlated
   $`\langle \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}}(x), \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{U}}(y) \rangle > 0, \forall x, y \in \Omega`$

### 3.3 Mono-Paradigm Holistic Observer Perspective

In the mono-paradigm system, observation is not an external observation of the internal, but the system's own reflexivity:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{U}} = U`$

The observation process is equivalent to self-mapping:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{U}}(\mathcal{U}) = U \circledast U = U`$

This leads to special properties of the observation effect:

1. **Complete Knowledge**: The system has complete knowledge of itself
   $`K(U, U) = I(U)`$, where $`K`$ is the knowledge function and $`I`$ is the information function

2. **Observational Consistency**: Observation does not change the system
   $`U \text{ after observation } = U`$

3. **Non-Dual Observation**: Observation does not create subject-object separation
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{U}} \circledast \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{U}`$

### 3.4 Holistic Properties of Mono-Paradigm State

The mono-paradigm system exhibits the following holistic properties:

1. **Emergent Holism**: Holistic properties cannot be reduced to the sum of parts
   $`P(U) \neq \sum_i P(\Pi_i(U))`$, where $`P`$ is the property function

2. **Collaborative Evolution**: All parts evolve collaboratively
   $`\frac{d\Pi_i(U)}{dt} = F(\{\Pi_j(U)\}_{j=1}^n)`$

3. **Holistic Adaptability**: The system as a whole has adaptability to internal changes
   $`\Delta S(U) \leq 0`$, where $`S`$ is the entropy function, indicating the system tends to reduce entropy

4. **Creativity**: The system can create new internal structures
   $`\exists t > 0: \Pi_i(U_t) \notin \{\Pi_j(U_0)\}_{j=1}^n`$

## 4. Applications and Verification

   - Unified description of all fundamental forces
   - Holographic universe principle

2. **Quantum Holism**: Quantum phenomena embody the characteristics of a mono-paradigm system

   - Research on the holistic coordination of artificial neural networks

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Holism of Mono-Paradigm State**

**Proof**:
Assume the mono-paradigm system $`\mathcal{U} = \{U\}`$ can be truly decomposed into independent parts $`U = A \sqcup B`$, where $`A \sqcap B = \emptyset`$.
According to Axiom 1, the system is a single whole, therefore $`A \circledast B = U`$.
If $`A \sqcap B = \emptyset`$, then $`A \circledast B`$ cannot produce the complete information of $`U`$.
This contradicts Axiom 1, so we must have $`A \sqcap B \neq \emptyset`$.
This proves that the mono-paradigm system cannot be truly decomposed into completely independent parts, embodying its holism.

**Theorem 2: Self-Reference of Mono-Paradigm State**

**Proof**:
According to Axiom 3, $`\mathcal{R}(U, U) = U`$.
This means that the relationship of the system with itself is equivalent to the system itself.
Therefore, $`U \circledast U = U`$, indicating that the system is completely self-referential.
This self-reference enables the system to completely contain itself, forming an infinite recursive structure.
Thus, the mono-paradigm system possesses complete self-reference.

**Theorem 3: Self-Sufficiency of Mono-Paradigm State**

**Proof**:
According to Axiom 2, $`\forall t \in \mathcal{T}, t(U) \subset U`$.
This indicates that any transformation acting on the system results in something still contained within the system.
Therefore, the system does not need external elements to complete all possible transformations and evolutions.
This proves the complete self-sufficiency of the mono-paradigm system.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Mono-Element Theory and Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Complementary Relationship Between Mono-Paradigm and Mono-Element States**

**Proof**:
In mono-element theory, the mono-element system is defined as a single indivisible element $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$.
In mono-paradigm theory, the mono-paradigm system is defined as a whole $`\mathcal{U} = \{U\}`$.
The mono-element state emphasizes the singularity and indivisibility of elements.
The mono-paradigm state emphasizes the unity and self-containment of the whole.
The two theories describe different aspects of the same reality: mono-element theory from the perspective of basic elements, mono-paradigm theory from the perspective of the whole.
Therefore, $`\mathcal{M} \cong \Pi_{\text{element}}(\mathcal{U})`$, $`\mathcal{U} \cong \Omega(\mathcal{M})`$.
This proves the complementarity and compatibility of the two theories.

**Theorem 5: Compatibility of Mono-Paradigm State with Cosmic Ontology**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, the universe state space is $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
In mono-paradigm theory, $`\mathcal{U} = \{U\}`$, where $`U`$ is the unified whole that contains everything.
From the mono-paradigm perspective, $`\Omega_Q`$ and $`\Omega_C`$ are two projections of the same whole $`U`$:
$`\Omega_Q = \Pi_Q(U), \Omega_C = \Pi_C(U)`$
and $`\Pi_Q(U) \circledast \Pi_C(U) = U`$
This is formally compatible with the relationship $`\Omega_C = \Omega_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q)`$ in cosmic ontology.
Therefore, mono-paradigm theory is essentially compatible with cosmic ontology.

**Theorem 6: Speciality of SHIFT Operation in Mono-Paradigm System**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, the SHIFT operation is defined as a state transfer mapping.
In the mono-paradigm system, the SHIFT operation manifests as $`\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}: U \rightarrow U'`$, where $`U' \subset U`$ and $`U \subset U'`$.
This means that SHIFT in the mono-paradigm system does not produce true external changes, but only internal reorganization.
This characteristic differs formally from the SHIFT operation in cosmic ontology, but is functionally compatible because:
$`\Pi(\text{SHIFT}_{\mathcal{U}}(U)) = \text{SHIFT}(\Pi(U))`$
This indicates that from a projection perspective, the SHIFT in the mono-paradigm system is equivalent to the standard SHIFT.
Therefore, the SHIFT operation in mono-paradigm theory is compatible with cosmic ontology.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimension Positioning

The mono-paradigm theory occupies a special position in the cosmic ontology dimension spectrum:

| Theory | Dimension | Relationship |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md) | 0 | Basic element perspective |
| [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md) | 1* | Holistic unity perspective |
| [Dual-Element Theory](formal_theory_dual_element_en.md) | 2 | Relational dualistic perspective |
| [Cosmic Ontology](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md) | 10 | Integrated perspective |

Dimensional relationship:
$`\text{Mono-Element Theory} \sim \text{Mono-Paradigm Theory} \preceq \text{Dual-Element Theory} \preceq ... \preceq \text{Cosmic Ontology}`$

where $`\sim`$ indicates a complementary relationship, and 1* indicates a holistic dimension, different from ordinary 1-dimension.

### 6.2 Theory Dependency Structure

The dependency structure of mono-paradigm theory is as follows:

1. **Dependent Theories**:
   - [Cosmic Ontology](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md) (provides the overall framework)

2. **Complementary Theories**:
   - [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md) (provides the element perspective)

3. **Depended On By**:
   - Non-Dual Theories
   - Holistic System Theories
   - Holographic Theories

4. **Reference Path**:
   [Cosmic Ontology](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md) ← [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md) ↔ [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md) → [Dual-Element Theory](formal_theory_dual_element_en.md)

### 6.3 Distinctions from Mono-Element Theory

The key distinctions between mono-paradigm theory and [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md) are:

1. **Perspective Difference**:
   - [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md): Describes the system from the perspective of basic elements
   - [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md): Describes the system from the perspective of holistic unity

2. **Operational Difference**:
   - [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md): Uses XOR operation, emphasizing binary logic of elements
   - [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md): Uses self-mapping operation $`\circledast`$, emphasizing the self-reference of the whole

3. **Structural Difference**:
   - [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md): Single element not further divisible
   - [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md): Whole contains infinite fractal structures

4. **Extension Method**:
   - [Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md): Extends by adding new elements
   - [Mono-Paradigm Theory](formal_theory_mono_paradigm_en.md): Extends through internal structural differentiation

These differences make the two theories form a complementary relationship, jointly constituting a more complete theoretical system.
