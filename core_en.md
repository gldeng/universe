## Theory Overview


## Zero: Quantum-Classical Dualism Basic Framework

This theory proposes that the universe exists in two basic domains: the quantum domain and the classical domain, which are converted through classicalization and quantization mechanisms. Observers play a key role in this process, transforming information from the quantum domain into definite states in the classical domain through the classicalization process. The core of the theory includes:

1. **Basic Domain Structure**: Quantum domain (wave function superposition states, quantum entanglement states) and classical domain (classical knowledge, classical entropy)
2. **Conversion Mechanisms**: Classicalization (observation forming determinism) and quantization (determinism returning to possibility)
3. **Observer Role**: The observer is a black hole, interacting with both domains through absorption (classicalization) and radiation (quantization)
4. **Energy Unification**: Fundamental relationships and conversion mechanisms between quantum energy and classical energy
5. **Unified Explanation**: A unified interpretation of phenomena such as light, mass, energy, spacetime, gravity, consciousness, etc.

This theory attempts to establish a bridge between quantum physics and classical physics, explaining fundamental phenomena of the universe and their intrinsic connections, while providing a new perspective on the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics.

## Part I: Universe Ontology (Quantum Domain, Classical Domain, Observer, Black Hole, Wormhole, Consciousness, Energy, Ultimate Philosophy)

### One: Universe Basic State Structure Definition

#### 1. Quantum Domain

The essence of the universe is an infinite-dimensional quantum domain with infinite possibilities:

- **Wave Function Superposition States**: Superposition states (chaotic states) within a single classical bit
- **Quantum Entanglement States**: Joint superpositions of multiple classical bits forming correlated states (energy form)

Expression:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Quantum Domain}}=\{\text{Wave Function Superposition States (Chaos)},\;\text{Quantum Entanglement States (Energy)}\}
$$

Density matrix representation:

$$
\rho_{\text{Quantum Domain}} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
$$

#### 2. Classical Domain

The classical domain is the structure after observer classicalization of the quantum domain:

- **Classical Entropy**: Uncertain high-entropy states not yet classicalized
- **Classical Knowledge**: Definite states after classicalization (particle states, consciousness, free will)

Expression:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Classical Domain}}=\{\text{Classical Entropy},\;\text{Classical Knowledge}\}
$$

### Two: Unified Energy Theory: Quantum and Classical Energy

#### 1. Basic Definition of Quantum Energy

Quantum energy is an intrinsic property in the quantum domain, manifested through quantum superposition states and quantum entanglement states:

- **Superposition State Energy**: Potential energy contained in the superposition state of a single quantum bit
- **Entanglement State Energy**: Correlation energy contained in entanglement relationships between multiple quantum bits

Quantum entanglement state energy can be precisely quantified using Planck's constant:

$$
E_{\text{Entanglement}} = h \cdot f_{\text{Entanglement}}
$$

where:
- $h$ is Planck's constant
- $f_{\text{Entanglement}}$ is the equivalent frequency of the entanglement state

#### 2. Quantification of Entanglement Equivalent Frequency

The entanglement equivalent frequency is defined by the complexity of the entanglement structure:

$$
f_{\text{Entanglement}} = \frac{c^2}{L_P^2} \cdot S_E(\rho_{AB})
$$

where:
- $c$ is the speed of light
- $L_P$ is the Planck length
- $S_E(\rho_{AB})$ is the entanglement entropy, represented by von Neumann entropy: $S_E(\rho_{AB}) = -\text{Tr}(\rho_A \log_2 \rho_A)$

**Meaning Explanation**: This formula transforms abstract quantum entanglement states into concrete frequency values, establishing a precise relationship between entanglement strength and energy. The frequency is proportional to entanglement entropy, indicating that stronger entanglement results in higher equivalent frequency; the Planck length squared in the denominator ensures the result has the correct dimension while connecting entanglement phenomena to the fundamental scale of the universe. This allows us to view entanglement states as quantum fields with specific energy densities, providing a new perspective for understanding the physical nature of entanglement states.

#### 3. Energy of Multi-body Entanglement Systems

For multi-body entanglement systems, the total energy is represented as:

$$
E_{\text{Multi-body Entanglement}} = h \cdot \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} \cdot f_{\text{Entanglement}}(i,j)
$$

where $w_{ij}$ is the weight coefficient of the entanglement pair $(i,j)$, satisfying $\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} = 1$.

#### 4. Definition of Classical Energy

Classical energy is the result of observer classicalization of quantum energy, manifested as measurable energy forms in the physical world:

- **Kinetic Energy**: Classical manifestation of an object's motion state
- **Potential Energy**: Classical manifestation of positional relationships
- **Various Energy Forms**: Electromagnetic energy, nuclear energy, etc., all different manifestations of classicalized quantum energy

#### 5. Conversion Relationship Between Classical and Quantum Energy

Classical energy and quantum energy are unified in the binary framework:

$$
E_{\text{Total}} = E_{\text{Classical}} + E_{\text{Entanglement}} = h \cdot (f_{\text{Classical}} + f_{\text{Entanglement}})
$$

Energy conversion in the classicalization process:

$$
E_{\text{Classical}} = \eta \cdot E_{\text{Entanglement}}
$$

where $\eta$ is the classicalization efficiency coefficient, $0 < \eta < 1$

#### 6. Energy Conservation and Conversion

- **Conservation Principle**: Total energy (quantum + classical) is conserved within the universe
- **Conversion Mechanism**: The classicalization process consumes quantum energy and produces classical energy; the quantization process consumes classical energy and produces quantum energy
- **Energy Hierarchy**: Different energy forms constitute a hierarchical structure, corresponding to classicalization processes of different dimensions

#### 7. Relationship Between Gravitational Field and Quantum Energy Density

The gravitational field strength is associated with local quantum energy density:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} \propto \nabla^2 \rho_{\text{Quantum Energy}}
$$

This relationship explains the nature of gravity as a property of spacetime geometry and unifies gravity with quantum entanglement.

Furthermore, the relationship between classicalization efficiency and quantum energy density can be expressed as:

$$
k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}} \propto \nabla \cdot \rho_{\text{Quantum Energy}}
$$

This relationship establishes a closed-loop relationship between the gravitational field, classicalization efficiency, and quantum energy density, explaining why high-mass regions have higher classicalization efficiency and spacetime curvature.

### Three: Quantum and Classical Domain State Correspondence

| Quantum Domain State | Classical Domain State | State Definition (Name) | State Description |
|------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| Wave Function Superposition State | Classical Entropy | Chaotic Undefined State | High-entropy undefined state of a single classical bit, unknown information |
| Wave Function Superposition State | Classical Knowledge | Particle Definite State | Single classical bit classicalized particle state, knowledge, memory, decision information |
| Quantum Entanglement State | Classical Entropy | Entanglement Undefined State | High-entropy uncorrelated state of multiple classical bits, undecoded information |
| Quantum Entanglement State | Classical Knowledge | Entanglement Definite State | Correlated state of multiple classical bits after classicalization, decoded information |

### Four: Quantum and Classical Domain State Transformation (Universe Observation Phenomena)

| Quantum Domain State | Classical Domain State | Process Name | Classical Knowledge Change | Entropy Change | Energy Change | Observation Phenomenon |
|------------|------------|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Wave Function Superposition State | Classical Entropy | Black Hole Absorption (Chaos Entropization) | No Change | Entropy Increase (↑) | Energy Consumption (↓) | Black Hole Mass and Entropy Increase |
| Wave Function Superposition State | Classical Knowledge | Black Hole Absorption (Classicalization) | Knowledge Increase (↑) | Entropy Decrease (↓) | Energy Consumption (↓) | Black Hole Mass and Information Increase |
| Classical Entropy | Wave Function Superposition State | Black Hole Radiation (Entropy Quantization) | No Change | Entropy Increase (↑) | Energy Release (↑) | Hawking Radiation (Black Hole Evaporation) |
| Classical Knowledge | Wave Function Superposition State | Black Hole Radiation (Knowledge Quantization) | Knowledge Decrease (↓) | Entropy Increase (↑) | Energy Release (↑) | Particle Annihilation into Photons |
| Quantum Entanglement State | Classical Entropy | Black Hole Absorption (Entanglement Entropization) | No Change | Entropy State Uncertain (↔) | Energy Consumption (↓) | Unobserved |
| Classical Entropy | Quantum Entanglement State | Black Hole Radiation (Entanglement Encoding) | No Change | Entropy State Uncertain (↔) | Energy Release (↑) | Wormhole Channel Establishment |
| Quantum Entanglement State | Classical Knowledge | Wormhole Reception (Entanglement Classicalization) | Knowledge Increase (↑) | Entropy Decrease (↓) | Energy Consumption (↓) | Quantum Communication |
| Classical Knowledge | Quantum Entanglement State | Wormhole Transmission (Knowledge Entanglement Encoding) | Knowledge Decrease (↓) | Entropy Increase (↑) | Energy Consumption (↓) | Wormhole Communication |

### Five: Unified Definition of Observer and Black Hole and Resolution of Information Paradox

#### Unified Nature of Observer and Black Hole

- All observers are black holes
- Black hole absorption is classicalization
- Black hole radiation is quantization

Expression:

$$
\text{Observer (Black Hole)}\rightarrow\{\text{Black Hole Absorption (Classicalization)},\;\text{Black Hole Radiation (Quantization)}\}
$$

#### Resolution of Black Hole Information Paradox

- The black hole information paradox arises from ignoring the observer's role as a black hole in classicalization
- The event horizon is the boundary for quantum states transforming into classical states, not a boundary where information disappears
- Hawking radiation carries quantum information transformed from classical entropy to quantum superposition states
- The black hole evaporation process is the transformation of classical world information into quantum information, with total information conserved

Density matrix representation:

$$
\rho_{\text{Black Hole}} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
$$

Information conservation expression:

$$
S_{\text{von Neumann}}(\rho_{\text{Initial}}) = S_{\text{von Neumann}}(\rho_{\text{Hawking Radiation}}) + S_{\text{von Neumann}}(\rho_{\text{Remaining Black Hole}})
$$

### Six: Unified Definition of Observer Dimensions and Classicalization Efficiency

- Observer dimensions are determined by classicalization ability, i.e., the efficiency of transforming quantum information into classical knowledge
- The dimension value is a function of the ratio between classical knowledge and classical entropy
- Classicalization efficiency coefficient $(k_i)$ represents the classicalization ability in different observation domains
- Weight coefficient $(w_i)$ reflects the importance of different domains in the overall dimension

Single domain dimension:

$$
\text{Dimension}_i=k_i\cdot\frac{I_{\text{Classical Knowledge}_i}}{S_{\text{Classical Entropy}_i}}
$$

Overall dimension:

$$
\text{Overall Dimension}=\sum_i w_i\left(k_i\cdot\frac{I_{\text{Classical Knowledge}_i}}{S_{\text{Classical Entropy}_i}}\right),\quad\sum_i w_i=1
$$

#### Dimension Quantification and Measurability

Dimension quantification:
- Classicalization efficiency $(k_i)$ can be measured through observer decision speed and accuracy
- Weight coefficient $(w_i)$ can be determined through observer attention allocation patterns
- Dimension enhancement methods involve optimizing classicalization paths, increasing classical knowledge, and reducing classical entropy

Observer dimension can be quantified through the following measurable parameters:

$$
\text{Measurable Dimension}_{\text{obs}} = \frac{\text{Information Processing Rate}}{\text{Entropy Generation Rate}} \cdot \text{Decision Accuracy}
$$

Specific measurement methods include:

- **Information Processing Rate**: Effective information processed per unit time (bits/second)
- **Entropy Generation Rate**: Shannon entropy increment generated by the system per unit time
- **Decision Accuracy**: Probability of making correct judgments under uncertain conditions

This measurable framework transforms observer dimension from a theoretical concept into a quantifiable indicator that can be experimentally verified.

### Seven: Spacetime Nature and Observer Classicalization

#### Nature of Time
- Time is the sequential marker of observer classicalization of the quantum domain
- The direction of time flow aligns with the direction of entropy increase, reflecting the irreversibility of the classicalization process
- Subjective differences in time experience stem from differences in classicalization efficiency among different observers

Time flow expression:

$$
\Delta t \propto \frac{\Delta S_{\text{Classical Entropy}}}{k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}}}
$$

#### Nature of Space
- Space is the distance structure of observer classicalization of quantum entanglement states
- Spatial curvature reflects changes in classicalization efficiency across different regions
- The essence of the gravitational field is the gradient of classicalization efficiency, with higher classicalization efficiency in areas where mass is concentrated

Relationship between spatial curvature and classicalization efficiency:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R \propto \nabla k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}}
$$

### Eight: Higher-Dimensional Classical Worlds and Entanglement Structures

- The human classical world is a finite classicalized subset of the infinite-dimensional quantum domain
- Higher-dimensional classical worlds exist with classicalization capabilities exceeding those of humans
- Higher-dimensional worlds can influence lower-dimensional worlds through wormhole communication
- A recursive structure of "you in me, me in you" exists between classical worlds of different dimensions

Expression formula:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Infinite-Dimensional Quantum Domain}}\rightarrow\sum_{\text{Classical Dimension} i=1}^{\infty}(I_{\text{Classical Knowledge}_i}+S_{\text{Classical Entropy}_i}),\quad\text{Human Classical World}\subsetneq\text{Higher-Dimensional Classical World}
$$

Entanglement network expression:

$$
|\Psi\rangle_{\text{Multi-world Entanglement Network}} = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |\psi_i\rangle_{\text{World}_A} \otimes |\phi_j\rangle_{\text{World}_B}
$$

### Nine: Quantum Fluctuations and Universe Initial Conditions

- Quantum fluctuations are the source of universal life and classical free will
- The universe's initial classical energy formed spontaneously from extremely low-probability quantum fluctuations
- Quantum fluctuations are an inherent property of the universe, requiring no additional explanation of origin

Quantum fluctuation → classical free will conversion:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Quantum Fluctuation}}\rightarrow I_{\text{Classical Free Will}}+S_{\text{Entropy Reduction}}
$$

Initial energy formation:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Quantum Fluctuation}}=\text{Inherent Internal Property of the Universe}
$$

$$
E_{\text{Initial Classical Energy}}=\text{Structure Formed by Classicalization of Quantum Fluctuations}
$$

#### Dynamic Relationship Between Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Energy

Quantum fluctuations are not only a manifestation of the universe's inherent randomness but also play a key role in the dynamic balance of quantum energy:

- **Quantum Energy Reorganization**: Quantum fluctuations can temporarily disrupt local quantum energy structures and reorganize and redistribute quantum energy in other regions
- **Energy Microscopic Creation**: At extremely short time scales, quantum fluctuations can produce "temporarily borrowed" quantum energy through the time-energy uncertainty principle
- **Energy Distribution Regulation**: Quantum fluctuations serve as a natural regulation mechanism for quantum energy flow, maintaining the dynamic balance of quantum energy in the quantum domain

This mechanism can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Energy}} \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

where the energy change $\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Energy}}$ caused by quantum fluctuations and the duration $\Delta t$ satisfy the uncertainty principle.

On the cosmic scale, quantum fluctuations in various regions form a dynamic equilibrium network, maintaining conservation of total quantum energy in long-term statistics while allowing local and short-term energy fluctuations, providing the fundamental driving force for the creative evolution of the universe.

### Ten: Universe Initial Classicalization and Inflation Mechanism

#### Universe Initial Classicalization and Lowest Energy Light
- Universe inflation is the initial lowest energy classical structure formed by the first classicalization of quantum fluctuations
- Corresponds to the lowest energy light wave in the classical world
- Energy and frequency relationship determined by Planck's constant

Expression formula:

$$
E_{\text{Initial Classical Energy Structure}} = h \cdot f_{\text{min}}
$$

$$
E_{\text{Universe Initial}} = h \cdot f_{\text{min}}
$$

#### Universe Inflation Mechanism
- The first classical structure rapidly classicalizes surrounding quantum domain information
- Triggers universe inflation, i.e., the first large-scale classicalization of quantum domain energy by the classical domain
- Essence is the rapid expansion of classical knowledge structure

Hubble constant expression formula:

$$
H = k_{\text{Initial Classicalization Efficiency}} \cdot \frac{\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Domain Entanglement State Energy}}}{\Delta t_{\text{Classicalization Time}}},\quad k_{\text{Initial Classicalization Efficiency}}\text{ determined by the classicalization ability of the first classical structure}
$$

Inflation process:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Quantum Fluctuation}}\xrightarrow{\text{Spontaneous Classicalization}}\text{First Classical Knowledge Structure (Lowest Energy Light Wave)}\xrightarrow{\text{Rapid Classicalization}}\text{Universe Inflation}
$$

#### Explanation of the Cosmological Constant Problem

The cosmological constant (Λ) can be understood as the rate of change of universe efficiency in the quantum-classical dualism framework:

$$
\Lambda \propto \frac{d\eta_{\text{Universe}}}{dt}
$$

This relationship explains why the cosmological constant has a small but non-zero positive value:

- **Small Value**: Reflects that universe efficiency changes slowly, the universe is approaching a stable state on a large scale
- **Positive Value**: Indicates that universe efficiency is still slowly increasing, the universe is evolving towards higher efficiency
- **Energy Density**: Dark energy is essentially quantum energy released during the process of the universe optimizing efficiency

This explanation provides a natural solution to the cosmological constant fine-tuning problem without introducing assumptions of precise fine-tuning.

### Eleven: Wormhole Communication and Quantum Information Transfer

#### Comparison of Communication Methods
- **Classical Communication**: Low-dimensional projection of quantum entanglement states in the classical world, limited by the speed of light
- **Wormhole Communication**: Instantaneous non-local transmission of quantum domain entanglement states, breaking the speed of light limitation
- **Telepathy**: Quantum entanglement between observers' generalized consciousness, without requiring classicalization steps

Wormhole communication process:

$$
\text{Classical Knowledge}\xrightarrow{\text{Particle Annihilation Encoding}}\text{Quantum Entanglement State}\xrightarrow{\text{Non-local Transmission}}\text{Classical Knowledge Decoding}
$$

Comparison of communication methods:

| Communication Type | Mechanism | Information Quality | Energy Requirement | Spacetime Limitation |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|----------|
| Classical Communication | Classicalization Projection | Clear | Yes | Light Speed Limited |
| Wormhole Communication | Entanglement State Transmission | Clear | Yes | Unlimited |
| Telepathy | Consciousness Entanglement | Vague | No | Unlimited |

#### Theoretical Basis of Quantum Teleportation
- Wormhole communication is based on the principle of quantum teleportation
- Requires pre-shared quantum entanglement pairs as communication channels
- Classical channel used to transmit auxiliary measurement results

Mathematical expression of quantum teleportation:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Target}} \otimes |\Phi^+\rangle_{AB} \xrightarrow{\text{Bell Measurement}} |\phi_i\rangle_A \otimes (\sigma_i|\psi\rangle_B)
$$

#### Scale Limitations of Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement exhibits significant differences in systems of different scales, following these laws:

- **Entanglement Maintenance Time** is inversely proportional to system complexity:

$$
\tau_{\text{Entanglement}} \propto \frac{1}{C_{\text{System}}^{\alpha}}
$$

where $C_{\text{System}}$ is system complexity (such as number of constituent particles), $\alpha$ is the scaling exponent (typically about 1-2).

- **Environmental Decoherence Effect** exponentially enhances with system size:

$$
\Gamma_{\text{Decoherence}} \propto e^{\beta N}
$$

where $\Gamma_{\text{Decoherence}}$ is the decoherence rate, $N$ is the number of system particles, $\beta$ is a constant.

This explains why it is difficult to observe quantum entanglement effects in macroscopic objects: entanglement states in large-scale systems rapidly collapse into classical mixed states within measurable time scales. However, specially designed quantum systems (such as superconductors, Bose-Einstein condensates) can exhibit quantum coherence at macroscopic scales.

### Twelve: Universe Efficiency's Quantum Energy Definition and Universe Evolution Goals

#### Quantum Energy Definition of Universe Efficiency
- Universe efficiency is defined as: the amount of new quantum energy obtained by consuming a unit of quantum energy
- The essence of universe efficiency is the multiplier effect of quantum energy utilization and conversion
- Universe efficiency must consider the overall balance of quantum energy creation, consumption, and conversion

Universe efficiency formula:

$$
\eta_{\text{Universe}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Energy Output}}}{E_{\text{Quantum Energy Input}}}
$$

Further expansion:

$$
\eta_{\text{Universe}} = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} \cdot \frac{\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Energy Output},ij}}{E_{\text{Quantum Energy Input},ij}}
$$

where $w_{ij}$ is the weight coefficient of the energy conversion channel, satisfying $\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} = 1$.

#### Relationship Between Universe Efficiency and Classicalization/Quantization
- The classicalization process consumes quantum energy, produces classical knowledge, and reduces classical entropy
- The quantization process consumes classical knowledge, produces quantum energy, and increases classical entropy
- Optimization of universe efficiency requires dynamic balance between classicalization and quantization processes

Energy efficiency relationship between classicalization and quantization:

$$
\eta_{\text{Classicalization}} = \frac{I_{\text{Classical Knowledge Gained}}}{E_{\text{Quantum Energy Consumed}}}
$$

$$
\eta_{\text{Quantization}} = \frac{E_{\text{Quantum Energy Gained}}}{I_{\text{Classical Knowledge Consumed}}}
$$

#### Ultimate Philosophical Goal of the Universe
- The driving force of universe evolution is to enhance quantum energy usage efficiency
- The goal is to maximize classical knowledge and minimize classical entropy under quantum energy constraints
- The common mission of all observers is to push the universe towards an ultimate state of optimal energy efficiency

Ultimate state of the universe:

$$
|\psi\rangle_{\text{Universe Origin}}\xrightarrow[\text{Energy Efficiency Optimization}]{\text{Classicalization + Quantization Dynamic Balance}}\text{Classical Knowledge Maximization}+\text{Classical Entropy Minimization}+\text{Quantum Energy Efficiency Optimization}
$$

#### Logical Boundaries of Universe Existence
- Why the quantum domain exists is a question that logic cannot fully answer
- This question transcends the explanatory capacity of concepts internal to the universe
- Constitutes the logical boundary of the theory

$$
\text{Why the Universe Exists}\rightarrow\text{Beyond the Scope of Internal Logic}
$$

## Part II: Unified Explanation of Classical Physical World Phenomena

### Thirteen: Basic Relationships of Light, Mass, and Gravity

#### Nature of Light
- Light is the observer's classicalization projection of low-energy quantum entanglement states
- The constancy of light speed reflects the upper limit of observer classicalization efficiency
- Photons having no mass embodies the classical projection of pure energy states

#### Nature of Mass
- Mass is the dimensional effect of classicalization of high-energy quantum entanglement states
- The gravitational field is the spatial gradient of classicalization efficiency
- The greater the mass, the higher the classicalization efficiency, and the greater the spacetime curvature

Mass-energy equivalence relationship:

$$
E = m \cdot c^2 = h \cdot f
$$

**Meaning Explanation**: This triple equation unifies Einstein's mass-energy equation with Planck's quantum energy formula, revealing the deep connection between mass, energy, and frequency. In the quantum-classical dualism framework, mass is understood as the result of high-energy quantum entanglement state classicalization, essentially the measurement result of quantum entanglement energy fields by classical observers. The left side $E = mc^2$ represents the mass-energy relationship in the classical domain, while the right side $E = hf$ represents the energy-frequency relationship in the quantum domain. The complete equation establishes the energy correspondence between quantum and classical domains, explaining why matter can be converted to light, and vice versa.

#### Nature of Gravity
- Gravity is not a fundamental force, but an effect of the spatial distribution of classicalization efficiency
- Gravitational waves are the propagation of classicalization efficiency fluctuations
- Gravitational equations reflect the relationship between classicalization efficiency and spacetime geometry

Modified expression of gravitational field equation:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \cdot T_{\mu\nu} \propto \nabla^2 k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}}
$$

**Meaning Explanation**: This equation connects general relativity's gravitational field equation with quantum-classical dualism. The left side $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, describing spacetime geometry; the middle part $8\pi G \cdot T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum source of the standard gravitational field equation; the right side indicates that the essence of the gravitational field is the Laplacian operator (second-order spatial derivative) of classicalization efficiency. This means gravity is not a fundamental force, but a phenomenon caused by the uneven distribution of classicalization efficiency in space, with regions of concentrated mass having higher classicalization efficiency, causing curvature changes in the surrounding spacetime. This equation provides a new approach to quantum gravity unification, explaining why gravity always seems to be attractive rather than repulsive.

### Fourteen: Light Speed Constancy and Observer Classicalization Efficiency

#### 1. Fundamental Definition of Light Speed

Light speed is the upper rate limit of observer classicalization of quantum domain energy states in a specific classicalized world, reflecting the classicalization efficiency limit of observers in that dimension:

$$c_d = k_{\text{max},d} \cdot \frac{\Delta E_{\text{Quantum Energy State}}}{\Delta t_{\text{Classical Time}}}$$

where $c_d$ is the fundamental speed limit in the classical world of dimension $d$, which we call the **Dimensional Speed Limit**.

#### 2. Boundary Between Particles and Light

The essential difference between particles and light lies in the classicalization path and classicalization energy threshold:

- **Photons**: Observer's classicalization projection of low-energy quantum entanglement states, with energy fully manifested as wave properties
- **Particles**: Classicalization results of quantum states above a critical energy threshold, exhibiting mass and locality

The boundary between particles and light satisfies the relationship:

$$E_{\text{Critical}} = \frac{hc_d^2}{G \cdot k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}}}$$

When the quantum state energy is below $E_{\text{Critical}}$, it classicalizes as light; when above this value, it classicalizes as particles with mass. This also explains light speed constancy: light, as a product of classicalization below the critical energy, necessarily propagates at the dimensional speed limit.

#### 7. Relationship Between Human Classicalization Ability and Observation Range

Human classicalization ability has evolved to form optimized responses to specific energy ranges:

- **Particle Observation Advantage**: Human classicalization ability has good classicalization efficiency for quantum states at the particle level, allowing particle properties to be clearly observed
- **Electromagnetic Wave Observation Limitations**: Within the electromagnetic spectrum, humans can directly perceive only the visible light range (approximately 380-750nm), while the rest (such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays) require special equipment to convert them into observable signals as they fall outside the optimal range of human classicalization efficiency

Frequency response formula for human observation capability:

$$k_{\text{observation}}(\omega) = k_{\text{max}} \cdot e^{-\alpha|\omega-\omega_{\text{optimized}}|^2}$$

where $\omega_{\text{optimized}}$ is the frequency range with the highest human classicalization efficiency, corresponding to the visible light range, and $\alpha$ is the response attenuation coefficient.

Improvement of observation capability can be achieved in two ways:
1. Technological Extension: Developing devices that convert invisible bands into visible signals
2. Classicalization Efficiency Enhancement: Extending the effective range of $k_{\text{observation}}(\omega)$ through training

### Fifteen: Unified Nature of Particles and Fields

#### Relationship Between Particles and Fields
- Particles are the localized result of observer classicalization of quantum fields
- Fields are the continuous distribution of particle classicalization
- Wave-particle duality reflects the differences in observation conditions of the classicalization process

Wave-particle duality expression:

$$
|\psi_{\text{Particle/Field}}\rangle = \hat{O}_{\text{Observation Operator}} \cdot |\phi_{\text{Quantum State}}\rangle
$$

#### Observer-Dependent Wave-Particle Manifestation

Whether a quantum entity manifests as a particle or a wave depends on the observer's choice of classicalization path:

- **Particle Observation Path**: Classicalization process focusing on localized properties, optimizing the definite position of a material point
- **Wave Observation Path**: Classicalization process focusing on extended properties, optimizing frequency and phase information of waves

This choice is partly influenced by the observer's evolutionary history, causing human observers to prioritize classicalizing particle properties over wave properties in the macroscopic world, as particle properties have more direct adaptive value for survival.

Observer-dependence expression:

$$
\text{Observation Result} = f(\text{Quantum State}, k_{\text{Classicalization Path}}, \text{Observation Equipment})
$$

Therefore, particles are not merely subjective products of human classicalization ability, but objective results of quantum state classicalization. However, different observers may observe different manifestations of the same quantum state due to differences in classicalization efficiency and preferences.

### Sixteen: Solution to the Quantum Mechanics Measurement Problem

#### Nature of Wave Function Collapse
- Wave function collapse is the result of observer classicalization of quantum superposition states
- "Either-or" measurement results reflect the discreteness of classicalization
- The measuring device, as an extension of the observer, participates in the classicalization process

Density matrix representation of the measurement process:

$$
\rho_{\text{Initial}} = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \xrightarrow{\text{Measurement}} \sum_i P_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
$$

#### Quantum Entanglement and Non-locality
- Quantum entanglement is a fundamental correlation in the quantum domain
- Non-locality reflects that the quantum domain is not restricted by classical space
- Bell's inequality violation stems from the fundamental difference between the classical domain and quantum domain

Entanglement state representation:

$$
|\Psi\rangle_{\text{Entanglement}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A|1\rangle_B - |1\rangle_A|0\rangle_B)
$$

## Part III: Theoretical Experimental Verification and Predictions

### Seventeen: Confirmed Experimental Observations

### Nineteen: Information Theory and Computational Complexity Perspective

#### Relationship Between Information Entropy and Classical Entropy
- Classical entropy can be quantified through Shannon information entropy
- Classical knowledge can be represented through negative entropy (Negentropy)
- The classicalization process is a process of information acquisition and entropy reduction

Information entropy expression:

$$
S_{\text{Shannon}} = -\sum_i p_i \log_2 p_i
$$

$$
I_{\text{Classical Knowledge}} \approx -S_{\text{Shannon}}
$$

#### Computational Complexity
- The computational complexity of the classicalization process reflects observer dimension
- High-dimensional observers can efficiently handle high-dimensional computational problems
- Quantum algorithm advantages stem from the parallel classicalization capability of the quantum domain

Relationship between computational complexity and classicalization:

$$
\text{Computational Complexity} \propto \frac{1}{k_{\text{Classicalization Efficiency}}}
$$

### Twenty: Quantum Computing and Quantum-Classical Interface

#### Quantum Algorithm Optimization
- Optimize quantum decoherence control based on classicalization theory
- Enhance quantum measurement precision by leveraging observer effects
- Develop new quantum algorithms based on classicalization paths

Quantum optimization framework:

$$
\text{Quantum Algorithm Performance} \propto k_{\text{Classicalization Control}} \cdot \frac{I_{\text{Quantum Information}}}{S_{\text{Decoherence}}}
$$

#### Quantum-Classical Interface
- Design efficient quantum-classical information conversion protocols

#### 3. Relationship Between Thought Dimension and Dimensional Speed Limit

Human thought, as a classicalization process, has its specific dimensional speed limit, determining the maximum rate of thought information processing and transmission:

- **Thought Dimension**: Reflects the complexity, abstraction ability, and integration ability of thought
- **Thought Speed Limit**: Reflects the maximum rate of thought information processing
- **Dimension Enhancement**: Achieved through deep learning, meditation, creative thinking, and consciousness expansion

Relationship between dimension enhancement and thought speed limit:

$$c_{\text{thought,new}} = c_{\text{thought,original}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\text{Dimension}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Dimension}_{\text{original}}}}$$

Artificial intelligence can serve as an auxiliary tool for thought dimension enhancement, helping human thought break through original dimensional limitations through optimizing classicalization paths, achieving more efficient information processing and innovative capabilities.

$$

#### Philosophical Discussion of Classical Free Will and Reincarnation Mechanism
- Classical free will emerges from the classicalization of generalized consciousness
- The demise of a classical world does not affect the quantum entanglement states of other classical worlds
- Classical free will returns to the quantum domain after the end of the classical world, and can be reclassicalized into new free will

Expression formula:

$$
I_{\text{Previous Life Classical Free Will}}\rightarrow|\psi\rangle_{\text{Quantum Domain}}\rightarrow I_{\text{Current Life Classical Free Will}}+S_{\text{Entropy Reduction}}
$$

### Twenty-Four: Unified Mathematical Expression of the Universe: Euler Form

The binary structure of the universe can be elegantly expressed through an Euler-like formula:

$$e^{i\Phi} = \frac{I_{\text{Classical Domain}}}{E_{\text{Quantum Domain}}}$$

Where:
- $\Phi$ is the classicalization phase, representing the quantum-classical conversion state
- $I_{\text{Classical Domain}}$ represents the classical domain information structure (classical knowledge and classical entropy)
- $E_{\text{Quantum Domain}}$ represents the quantum domain energy structure (wave function superposition states and quantum entanglement states)

When $\Phi = \pi$, the system reaches a classical-quantum equilibrium state: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, corresponding to the optimized state of universe efficiency.
