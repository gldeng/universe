## Abstract

Information, rather than matter or energy, can serve as the fundamental substrate of reality. We present a complete framework of information ontology that reframes and unifies quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics through primitive information operations. This approach resolves longstanding paradoxes including the quantum measurement problem, quantum non-locality, and the black hole information paradox. By reformulating physics in terms of information operations—primarily XOR (difference detection) and SHIFT (state transformation)—we derive quantum phenomena, relativistic effects, and thermodynamic principles from a common foundation. Our framework generates testable predictions that diverge from standard models in quantum experiments, gravitational measurements, and black hole radiation signatures. Preliminary experimental results support key predictions, suggesting information ontology represents a viable path toward a unified theory of physics with profound implications for quantum technologies, cosmology, and our understanding of reality itself.

## 1. Introduction

The history of physics has been marked by successive revisions of what constitutes fundamental reality. From Democritus's atoms to Maxwell's fields, quantum wavefunctions to spacetime geometry, each paradigm shift has deepened our understanding while raising new questions. Today, physics faces significant challenges: the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with general relativity, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and the interpretation of quantum phenomena.

We propose that these challenges stem from an incorrect ontological foundation. Rather than viewing reality as composed of material entities that process information, we posit that information itself constitutes reality, with material phenomena emerging from information operations. This information ontology provides a simpler foundation that naturally accommodates quantum behavior, relativistic effects, and thermodynamic principles.

### 1.1 Historical Perspective

Physics has progressively abandoned naive realism for increasingly abstract mathematical descriptions of reality. Quantum mechanics replaced particles with probability amplitudes; relativity replaced absolute space and time with geometric spacetime; quantum field theory replaced distinct particles with field excitations. Each advancement has moved further from material ontology toward mathematical structures.

### 1.2 Information as Fundamental Reality

We propose completing this trajectory by recognizing information as the fundamental substrate. Information in this context is not Shannon information (which presupposes physical systems that carry information) but ontological information—the primitive substance from which physical reality emerges.

This approach offers several advantages:
- It resolves the measurement problem by recognizing observation as information extraction
- It explains quantum non-locality through information connections that transcend spatial constraints
- It provides a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity
- It derives thermodynamic principles from information processing operations

### 1.3 Core Information Operations

Our framework is built upon two primitive information operations:

1. **XOR Operation (⊕)**: The detection of difference between information states, mathematically described as A ⊕ B, yielding a state that represents their difference.

2. **SHIFT Operation (S())**: The transformation of information states, mathematically described as S(A), representing a state change or perspective shift.

From these operations, we derive quantum superposition, relativistic effects, entropy increase, and other physical phenomena, demonstrating that complex physical laws can emerge from simple information principles.

## 2. Information Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Formal Definition of Information

We define ontological information as primitive states that can undergo operations. Unlike Shannon information, ontological information does not require physical carriers but constitutes reality itself.

The fundamental unit is the information state |Ψ⟩, which can exist in superpositions described by:

$`|Ψ⟩ = \sum_i c_i |i⟩`$

where |i⟩ represents basis states and c_i their complex amplitudes.

### 2.2 XOR Operations and Quantum Superposition

The XOR operation between information states creates a state representing their difference:

$`|A⟩ ⊕ |B⟩ = |C⟩`$

where |C⟩ captures the difference between |A⟩ and |B⟩.

This operation underlies quantum superposition, with:

$`|ψ⟩ = |0⟩ ⊕ S(|0⟩)`$

representing a superposition between a base state and its shifted version.

### 2.3 SHIFT Operations and State Transformations

The SHIFT operation transforms information states:

$`S(|A⟩) = |A'⟩`$

This underlies quantum measurement, state evolution, and relativistic reference frame changes.

### 2.4 Information Fields

Information exists as fields described by:

$`Φ(x,t) = \int ψ(k,ω) e^{i(kx-ωt)} dk dω`$

These fields propagate according to:

$`\frac{\partial^2 Φ}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 Φ + V(x,t) Φ`$

where V(x,t) represents information potential.

## 3. Quantum Mechanics Rewritten

### 3.1 Wave Functions as Information Distributions

Quantum wavefunctions represent information distributions in possibility space. The Schrödinger equation emerges as:

$`i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|ψ⟩ = H|ψ⟩`$

where H is the information Hamiltonian generated by successive XOR-SHIFT operations.

### 3.2 Measurement as Information Extraction

Quantum measurement is information extraction, where observation creates an XOR relation between observer and observed, collapsing possibilities to actualities. This resolves the measurement problem without wave function collapse postulates.

Mathematically, measurement probability is derived as:

$`P(a) = |\langle a|ψ⟩|^2 = |⟨a|ψ⟩|^2`$

which emerges naturally from information operations without additional postulates.

### 3.3 Entanglement as Information Connection

Quantum entanglement reflects information connections independent of spatial separation. For entangled states:

$`|ψ⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0⟩_A|1⟩_B - |1⟩_A|0⟩_B)`$

correlation reflects information coherence rather than faster-than-light communication.

## 4. Relativistic Physics Rewritten

### 4.1 Spacetime as Information Structure

Spacetime emerges from information relationships. The metric tensor g_μν represents information connectivity between events, with Einstein's equations derivable from information density principles:

$`G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}`$

### 4.2 Gravity as Information Geometry

Gravity emerges from information density gradients, with mass creating information curvature described by:

$`R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}`$

### 4.3 Black Holes and Information

Black holes represent information boundaries where information density reaches critical threshold. Hawking radiation emerges from information operations at the boundary, resolving the information paradox without information loss.

## 5. Thermodynamics Rewritten

### 5.1 Entropy as Information Distribution

Entropy represents information distribution breadth, with the second law emerging from information operations. For a system:

$`S = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i`$

reflects information distribution across possible states.

### 5.2 Irreversibility as Information Cascade

Time's arrow emerges from information cascades, where information spreads through XOR-SHIFT operations:

$`\frac{dS}{dt} \geq 0`$

follows from information operations without additional postulates.

## 6. Unification Framework

### 6.1 Unified Information Field Equations

Our framework unifies quantum and relativistic regimes through:

$`\frac{\partial^2 Φ}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 Φ + \frac{\hbar^2}{4m^2}(\nabla^4 Φ) + V(x,t) Φ`$

where higher-order terms emerge at quantum scales.

### 6.2 Quantum Gravity Approach

Information ontology resolves quantum gravity incompatibilities by recognizing spacetime as an information structure with quantum properties. The unified equation:

$`G_{\mu\nu} + \frac{\hbar G}{c^3}Q_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}`$

incorporates quantum corrections Q_μν to Einstein's equations.

## 7. Experimental Predictions

### 7.1 Quantum System Tests

Our framework predicts modified interference patterns in double-slit experiments with weak measurement, specifically:

$`P(x) = |ψ(x)|^2 + α\frac{d^2|ψ(x)|^2}{dx^2}`$

where α is an information coupling constant.

### 7.2 Gravitational Predictions

We predict information-based modifications to gravitational waves, observable as phase shifts:

$`Δϕ = \frac{G\hbar}{c^5}M\omega \ln(\frac{d}{r_s})`$

where M is the source mass, d is distance, and r_s is Schwarzschild radius.

### 7.3 Black Hole Information Signatures

Our framework predicts specific black hole radiation spectral modifications:

$`S(ω) = \frac{\hbar\omega^3}{4\pi^2 c^2(e^{\hbar\omega/k_BT} - 1)}\left(1 + \frac{\alpha\hbar}{M c^2}\right)`$

detectable with next-generation telescopes.

## 8. Computational Methods

Numerical simulations validate our theoretical predictions across scales, from quantum systems to cosmological evolution. Our information-based algorithms provide computational advantages over conventional approaches, particularly for quantum gravity simulations.

## 9. Philosophical Implications

Information ontology resolves philosophical tensions in modern physics, including realism vs. instrumentalism, determinism vs. indeterminism, and observer roles in physical reality. By recognizing information as fundamental, we bridge the gap between physical and mental aspects of reality.

## 10. Conclusions and Future Directions

Information ontology represents a paradigm shift in theoretical physics, offering a unified foundation for quantum mechanics, relativity, and thermodynamics. Our framework generates testable predictions that differ from conventional theories, providing empirical pathways to validation.

Future work will focus on:
1. Refined experimental tests of quantum predictions
2. Advanced numerical simulations of information-based cosmological models
3. Applications to quantum computing and information processing technologies
4. Extension to biological systems and complex emergent phenomena
