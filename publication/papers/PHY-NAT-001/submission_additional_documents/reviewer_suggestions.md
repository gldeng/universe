# Reviewer Suggestions

## Recommended Reviewers

1. **Prof. Elena Quantum**
   - Institution: ETH Zurich, Institute for Quantum Physics
   - Email: e.quantum@ethz.ch
   - Expertise: Quantum foundations, information theory, quantum information
   - Relevance: Prof. Quantum's pioneering work on information-theoretic approaches to quantum phenomena makes her ideally suited to evaluate the quantum aspects of our unification framework.

2. **Prof. David Relativity**
   - Institution: Princeton University, Department of Physics
   - Email: d.relativity@princeton.edu
   - Expertise: General relativity, gravitational theory, black hole physics
   - Relevance: Prof. Relativity's extensive work on information preservation in curved spacetime directly relates to our treatment of information fields in gravitational contexts.

3. **Prof. Sarah Complexity**
   - Institution: Santa Fe Institute
   - Email: s.complexity@santafe.edu
   - Expertise: Complex systems, emergence, information theory
   - Relevance: Prof. Complexity's interdisciplinary background in information-based complex systems makes her ideal for evaluating our framework's cross-scale applications.

4. **Prof. Michael Informatics**
   - Institution: University of Oxford, Department of Computer Science
   - Email: m.informatics@cs.ox.ac.uk
   - Expertise: Quantum computing, information theory, computational physics
   - Relevance: Prof. Informatics bridges computer science and physics, with particular expertise in XOR-based algorithms that relate to our fundamental operations.

5. **Dr. Yuki Entanglement**
   - Institution: University of Tokyo, Quantum Information Research Center
   - Email: y.entanglement@u-tokyo.ac.jp
   - Expertise: Quantum entanglement, quantum-to-classical transition
   - Relevance: Dr. Entanglement's experimental work on measuring quantum correlations across scales is directly relevant to our mesoscopic predictions.

## Reviewers to Exclude

1. **Prof. Thomas Classical**
   - Institution: Imperial College London
   - Reason: Prof. Classical has publicly expressed strong opposition to information-based interpretations of physical theory, which could lead to biased evaluation.

2. **Prof. Anna String**
   - Institution: Harvard University
   - Reason: Prof. String is heavily invested in string theory approaches to quantum gravity and has competing theoretical frameworks that could create a conflict of interest.
