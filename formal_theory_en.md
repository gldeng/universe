## Complete Core Theory Description

### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified to four core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $\Omega_C$ (space of determined reality) connected through an interface domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be converted between quantum information (possibilities in superposition states) and classical information (determined knowledge):

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the classicalization operator (the process that transforms quantum possibilities into classical certainties), $I(\psi)$ is the total information content of state $\psi$, and $I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$ is the portion converted to hidden information during classicalization.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that perform quantum→classical conversions, with conversion capacity determining their dimensionality:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{classical knowledge}}{S_{classical entropy}+\epsilon}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into determined knowledge), $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $K_C^\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimension Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization and quantization capabilities, while the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can form the quantum domain basis for lower-dimensional observers:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{classical knowledge}}{S_{classical entropy}+\epsilon}$$

$$\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}$$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting based on their capability range within specific dimensions.

### Quantum and Classical Domains

The fundamental properties of quantum and classical domains are summarized through the following key points:

#### Quantum Domain Core Properties

1. **Wave Function Superposition State** (chaotic state): system exists simultaneously in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $$\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

2. **Quantum Entangled State** (energy form): different parts form inseparable whole correlations
   $$\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: correlations beyond spacetime limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

#### Classical Domain Core Properties

1. **Classical Knowledge** (determined information): precisely measurable and describable determined states
   $$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

2. **Classical Entropy** (measure of uncertainty): measure of system disorder and information loss
   $$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

3. **Locality and Determinism**: finite propagation speed of interactions and measurement determinism
   $$P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)$$

### Multiscale Dualism Hierarchy

Multiscale dualism hierarchy theory extends the single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$$\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}$$

where:
- $\Omega_Q^{(i)}$ is the quantum domain at level i (possibility space at that level)
- $\Omega_C^{(i)}$ is the classical domain at level i (determined realization at that level)

The inter-level mapping functions are defined as:

$$\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}$$

$$\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}$$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, producing infinite recursive reality levels.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}$ between the quantum domain and the classical domain:

$$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q$$

satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: transformation of transformation equals identity
   $$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}$$
   $$\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}$$

2. **Information Preservation**: information quantity unchanged before and after transformation
   $$I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))$$

3. **Uncertainty-Certainty Transformation**: quantum uncertainty and classical certainty mutual conversion
   $$U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k$$

where $U_Q$ is the quantum uncertainty measure, $D_C$ is the classical certainty measure, and $k$ is a universal constant.
