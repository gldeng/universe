## Basic Framework

In the framework of quantum-classical dualism, gravity and spacetime are viewed as large-scale emergent phenomena of the quantum-classical interface, rather than fundamental interactions. This perspective offers a novel approach to quantum gravity, resolving many difficulties found in standard quantum gravity methods.

### Dual Nature of Gravity

Gravity occupies a unique position in dualism, simultaneously connecting the quantum and classical domains:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_{\mathcal{C}}
$$

where:
- $`G_{\mu\nu}`$ is the Einstein tensor, belonging to the classical domain
- $`\hat{T}_{\mu\nu}`$ is the quantum energy-momentum operator, belonging to the quantum domain
- $`\langle \cdot \rangle_{\mathcal{C}}`$ denotes the classicalization operation performed by observer $`\mathcal{O}`$

This indicates that the gravitational field is the result of the observer performing quantum→classical information conversion, rather than a pre-existing field.

### Gravity-Quantum Relationship

The tension between gravity and quantum theory can be formulated as a conversion problem between two different types of information representation:

$$
\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{C}(\Psi_Q))
$$

where:
- $`\mathcal{G}`$ is the gravitational field/spacetime geometry
- $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the mapping from classical information to spacetime geometry
- $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the classicalization function
- $`\Psi_Q`$ is the quantum state

The essential difficulty of quantum gravity lies in finding appropriate $`\mathcal{F}`$ and $`\mathcal{C}`$ functions that make the quantum-classical conversion self-consistent.

## Spacetime Emergence Mechanism

Spacetime is not a fundamental existence, but an effective description that emerges from deeper quantum structures.

### Spacetime Emergence Equation

The emergence process from quantum states to classical spacetime can be expressed as:

$$
g_{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{T}[S(\rho_{\mathcal{I}})]
$$

where:
- $`g_{\mu\nu}`$ is the spacetime metric
- $`\mathcal{T}`$ is the tensor emergence function
- $`S(\rho_{\mathcal{I}})`$ is the entanglement structure of the interface region quantum state $`\rho_{\mathcal{I}}`$

The emergence process is driven by entropy potential gradients:

$$
\frac{\partial g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 \frac{\delta S(\rho_{\mathcal{I}})}{\delta \rho_{\mathcal{I}}}
$$

where $`\kappa`$ is the response coefficient, related to the Planck scale.

### Quantum Network of Spacetime

At the most fundamental level, spacetime consists of quantum network nodes:

$$
\Gamma = (V, E, \omega)
$$

where:
- $`V`$ is the set of quantum nodes
- $`E \subseteq V \times V`$ is the entanglement connections between nodes
- $`\omega: E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}`$ is the entanglement strength weight function

The macroscopic spacetime metric emerges from the network connection topology:

$$
g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j \in \Gamma_N(x)} \omega(i,j) (v_i)_\mu (v_j)_\nu
$$

where $`\Gamma_N(x)`$ is the subnet of N nodes near point $`x`$, and $`(v_i)_\mu`$ is the space embedding vector of node $`i`$.

### Quantum Causal Sets

The causal structure of spacetime emerges from the partial ordering of quantum correlations:

$$
x \prec y \iff \exists \mathcal{C}: \mathcal{C}(\rho_x) \text{ informationally influences } \mathcal{C}(\rho_y)
$$

where $`\prec`$ denotes the causal precedence relation. Lorentz invariance acts as an emergent symmetry, rather than a fundamental one.

In quantum causal sets, Minkowski spacetime is a special case:

$$
d\tau^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu = \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i,j} \omega_{ij} \Delta x_i \Delta x_j
$$

## Quantum Gravity Interface Dynamics

In the quantum-classical interface region, gravity exhibits unique hybrid quantum-classical behavior.

### Semiclassical Gravity Equations

The gravitational dynamics in the interface region is described by the semiclassical Einstein equation, but with correction terms:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle + \Theta_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{D})
$$

where $`\Theta_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{D})`$ is the quantum-classical interface correction tensor, dependent on the disentanglement measure $`\mathcal{D}`$:

$$
\Theta_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal{D}) = \alpha(\mathcal{D} - \mathcal{D}_c)g_{\mu\nu} + \beta \nabla_\mu \mathcal{D} \nabla_\nu \mathcal{D} + \gamma R_{\mu\nu} \ln\left(\frac{\mathcal{D}}{\mathcal{D}_c}\right)
$$

This correction is significant in strongly quantum regions (black holes, early universe).

### Entropic Gravity

Gravity can be viewed as a manifestation of entropic tendency, closely related to the entropy of the quantum-classical interface:

$$
F_{\text{gravity}} = T \nabla S_{\mathcal{I}}
$$

where $`S_{\mathcal{I}}`$ is the entropy associated with the interface position. The increase in classicalization entropy provides the directionality of gravity.

The Einstein equations can be reformulated as entropy balance conditions:

$$
\delta S_{\text{total}} = \delta S_{\text{interface}} + \delta S_{\text{matter}} = 0
$$

When the system reaches an entropy extremum configuration, the spacetime curvature and energy distribution achieve balance.

### Quantum Geometric Fluctuations

The geometry in the interface region exhibits quantum fluctuations:

$$
\Delta g_{\mu\nu} \Delta R^{\mu\nu} \geq \frac{\hbar}{V_{\text{region}}}
$$

This uncertainty relation indicates that on small scales, spacetime geometry and curvature cannot be simultaneously determined with precision.

The fluctuation spectrum of the spacetime metric:

$$
P(k) = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + (kl_P)^2}
$$

where $`l_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}`$ is the Planck length.

## Quantum Entanglement and Spacetime Structure

There is a profound connection between quantum entanglement and spacetime structure, suggesting that entanglement may be the fundamental "building block" of spacetime.

### Extension of the ER=EPR Relation

Quantum-classical dualism extends the ER=EPR relation:

$$
\text{entanglement}(A:B) \Leftrightarrow \text{spacetime connection}(A,B) \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{I}_{A \cap B} \neq \emptyset
$$

This indicates that an interface connection exists between any entangled systems, which under specific conditions manifests as a classical Einstein-Rosen bridge.

The quantitative expression of this relationship:

$$
S_{\text{entanglement}}(A:B) = \frac{\text{Area}(\mathcal{I}_{A \cap B})}{4G\hbar}
$$

### Entanglement and Spacetime Dimensions

The dimensionality of spacetime is directly related to the entanglement structure of quantum systems:

$$
d_{\text{spacetime}} = \log_2 \chi + 1
$$

where $`\chi`$ is the entanglement complexity of the system (geometric mean of Schmidt numbers).

This explains why macroscopic classical spacetime is 3+1 dimensional—it corresponds to quantum systems with specific entanglement structures.

### Holographic Principle Reconstruction

The holographic principle has a natural explanation in the quantum-classical interface:

$$
S_{\text{max}} = \frac{A}{4l_P^2} = \frac{A}{4G\hbar}
$$

The area of the interface region limits the maximum amount of classicalized information it can carry. This is not an independent assumption of the theory, but a natural consequence derived from the limitations of quantum-classical information conversion.

## Black Hole Information Paradox Solution

Quantum-classical dualism provides a new solution to the black hole information paradox.

### Black Holes as Quantum-Classical Converters

Black holes are essentially extreme quantum-classical interface regions:

$$
\mathcal{D}_{\text{black hole}}(r) = \mathcal{D}_c \cdot \tanh\left(\frac{r - r_s}{l_P}\right)
$$

where $`r_s`$ is the Schwarzschild radius.

This understanding explains the dual nature of black holes:
- External observer: Information is classicalized and radiated away
- Internal observer: Information maintains quantum integrity

### Black Hole Information Preservation Mechanism

The apparent loss of information during black hole evaporation occurs because information undergoes a quantum→classical→quantum conversion cycle:

$$
|\psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_{\text{black hole}}} K_C^{\text{Hawking radiation}} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{Q}_{\text{universe}}} |\psi_{\text{final}}\rangle
$$

Information is preserved but highly reorganized, satisfying:

$$
I(|\psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle) = I(|\psi_{\text{final}}\rangle)
$$

But the relationship between the two is extremely complex, requiring the quantum computational capacity of the entire universe to decode.

### Black Hole Entropy Explanation

Black hole entropy has a dual interpretation:

$$S_{\text{black hole}} = \frac{A}{4G\hbar} = \begin{cases}
S_{\text{von Neumann}}(\rho_{\text{internal}}) & \text{for quantum observers} \\
S_{\text{Shannon}}(K_C^{\text{external}}) & \text{for classical observers}
\end{cases}$$

This dual interpretation eliminates contradictions in black hole entropy calculations, unifying quantum and thermodynamic descriptions.

## Cosmological Implications

Quantum-classical dualism provides a new perspective for cosmology.

### Universe as Quantum-Classical Interface Evolution

The entire universe can be viewed as a massive quantum-classical phase transition process:

$$
\mathcal{D}_{\text{universe}}(t) = \mathcal{D}_c \cdot \tanh\left(\frac{t-t_c}{t_P}\right)
$$

where $`t_c`$ is the critical time (when the universe's quantum-classical phase transition occurs), and $`t_P`$ is the Planck time.

This view naturally explains the highly quantum nature of the early universe and the highly classical nature of the late universe.

### New Explanation for Accelerated Expansion

Dark energy may originate from the tension of the quantum-classical interface:

$$
\rho_{\Lambda} \propto \sigma_{\mathcal{I}} \cdot H(t) \cdot \frac{d\mathcal{D}_{\text{universe}}}{dt}
$$

where $`\sigma_{\mathcal{I}}`$ is the interface tension, and $`H(t)`$ is the Hubble parameter.

This explains why dark energy begins to dominate at a specific age of the universe—it corresponds to a specific stage in the universe's quantum-classical phase transition.

### Initial Conditions Problem

The initial state of the universe is not finely tuned, but the natural result of classicalization of a quantum state:

$$
\rho_{\text{universe}}^{\text{classical}} = \mathcal{C}_{\text{big bang}}(|\Psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle)
$$

Most possible quantum initial states $`|\Psi_{\text{initial}}\rangle`$ would produce classical states similar to our universe after classicalization, resolving the fine-tuning problem.

## Observer-Dependent Gravitational Field

In quantum-classical dualism, the gravitational field is partially dependent on observer characteristics.

### Observer Gravity Equation

The extended Einstein equation includes observer terms:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}} + \Lambda_\mathcal{O} g_{\mu\nu}
$$

where $`\Lambda_\mathcal{O}`$ is the effective cosmological constant associated with observer $`\mathcal{O}`$, satisfying:

$$
\Lambda_\mathcal{O} \propto \frac{I(K_C^\mathcal{O})}{V_{\text{observed}}S(K_C^\mathcal{O})}
$$

This explains why different observers might measure slightly different gravitational constants and cosmological constants.

### Observer Network Dependence of the Gravitational Field

The macroscopic gravitational field emerges as a collective effect of multi-level observer networks:

$$
G_{\mu\nu}^{\text{effective}} = \sum_{k=1}^n w_k G_{\mu\nu}^{(k)}
$$

where $`G_{\mu\nu}^{(k)}`$ is the gravitational field component contributed by the level k observer network, and $`w_k`$ is the weight factor.

This leads to the possibility of small but measurable variations in the gravitational field in different biological systems and social environments.

## Experimental Predictions

The quantum gravity theory within the quantum-classical dualism framework offers multiple verifiable predictions.

### Scale-Dependent Gravitational Constant

The gravitational constant has small variations at different scales:

$$
G(r) = G_0 \left(1 + \alpha \ln\frac{r}{r_0}\right)
$$

where $`\alpha \approx 10^{-10}`$ is the quantum-classical coupling coefficient. This can be detected through high-precision satellite experiments.

### Gravitational Wave Dispersion Relation

Gravitational waves of different frequencies have slightly different propagation speeds:

$$
v(f) = c \left(1 - \beta \left(\frac{f}{f_P}\right)^2\right)
$$

where $`\beta \approx 10^{-20}`$, and $`f_P \approx 10^{43}`$ Hz is the Planck frequency.

### Spacetime Entanglement Experiment

Prediction of quantum entanglement affecting local gravitational fields:

$$
\Delta g_{\text{local}} \approx G\frac{E_{\text{entanglement}}}{c^2 r^2} \approx G\frac{\hbar f_{\text{entanglement}}}{c^2 r^2}
$$

This can be tested by creating large-scale quantum entangled states near precision gravimeters.

## Mathematical Formalism

Rigorous mathematical treatment of quantum gravity and spacetime emergence.

### Interface Gravity Functional

The interface gravity action can be expressed as:

$$
S_{\text{interface gravity}} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[R + L_{\text{interface}}(\mathcal{D}, \nabla \mathcal{D})\right]
$$

where the interface Lagrangian is:

$$
L_{\text{interface}} = \alpha (\mathcal{D} - \mathcal{D}_c)^2 - \beta g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu \mathcal{D} \nabla_\nu \mathcal{D} - \gamma R\ln\left(\frac{\mathcal{D}}{\mathcal{D}_c}\right)
$$

### Spacetime Evolution Equation

The complete equation for spacetime dynamics:

$$
\frac{\partial g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial \lambda} = -2(R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}) - 8\pi G \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle_{\mathcal{C}} - T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathcal{D}}
$$

where $`\lambda`$ is the evolution parameter, and $`T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathcal{D}}`$ is the interface energy-momentum tensor.

### Quantum Gravity Fluctuation Equation

The dynamics equation for spacetime quantum fluctuations:

$$
\Box h_{\mu\nu} + 2R_{\mu\alpha\nu\beta}h^{\alpha\beta} = 16\pi G \Delta \langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \rangle + \Xi_{\mu\nu}
$$

where $`\Xi_{\mu\nu}`$ is the quantum fluctuation source term, coming from interface dynamics:

$$\Xi_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3} \cdot \frac{\delta^2 S_{\text{interface}}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}\delta g_{\alpha\beta}} \cdot h^{\alpha\beta}
