## Classical Domain Basic Definition

The Classical Domain $`\Omega_C`$ is defined as the part of the universe that follows classical physical laws, representing deterministic reality space. The Classical Domain has the following basic characteristics:

1. **Determinism**: System states can be precisely determined
2. **Locality**: Interactions propagate through proximity
3. **Separability**: Systems can be decomposed into independent parts
4. **Continuity**: Physical quantities can change continuously
5. **Objectivity**: Observation results are independent of observers

Mathematically, the Classical Domain is defined by two basic components:

$$\Omega_C = \{K_C + S_C | K_C \text{ is the set of classical knowledge}, S_C \text{ is classical entropy}\}$$

where the total amount of classical information is conserved:

$$I_C = I(K_C) + I(S_C) = \text{constant}$$

## Classical Knowledge and Classical Entropy

### Classical Knowledge

Classical Knowledge $`K_C`$ is the explicitly determined information in the Classical Domain, composed of a series of definite states:

$$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

where:
- $`x_i`$ is position coordinate
- $`p_i`$ is momentum
- $`E_i`$ is energy
- $`s_i`$ is spin
- $`t_i`$ is time

The amount of classical knowledge information:

$$I(K_C) = \sum_i \log_2(1 + \frac{\Delta_i^{\text{max}}}{\Delta_i})$$

where $`\Delta_i`$ is the uncertainty of variable $`i`$, and $`\Delta_i^{\text{max}}`$ is the maximum possible uncertainty.

### Classical Entropy

Classical Entropy $`S_C`$ is the measure of uncertainty in the Classical Domain, following Shannon information entropy:

$$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

where $`k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}`$ is the Boltzmann constant, establishing the connection between information entropy and physical entropy.

The amount of classical entropy information:

$$I(S_C) = \sum_i p_i \log_2(1/p_i)$$

### Knowledge-Entropy Duality Relationship

There exists a duality relationship between classical knowledge and classical entropy:

$$K_C \leftrightarrow S_C$$

$$\frac{dK_C}{dt} = -\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \delta_{\text{exchange}}$$

where $`\delta_{\text{exchange}}`$ represents the knowledge-entropy exchange term with external systems.

## Classical Domain State Space

The state space of the Classical Domain is phase space, where each system is completely determined by position and momentum:

$$\Gamma_C = \{(q_i, p_i) | i = 1,2,...,N\}$$

For a system with $`N`$ degrees of freedom, the phase space dimension is $`2N`$.

Phase space volume is quantized as a carrier of classical information:

$$V_{\Gamma} = \int_{\Gamma} d^Nq \, d^Np$$

Information density in phase space:

$$\rho_{\Gamma}(q,p) = \frac{1}{h^N} \exp\left(-\frac{H(q,p) - F}{k_BT}\right)$$

where $`h`$ is Planck's constant, and $`F`$ is the free energy.

### Classical Domain State Space Dimension

The dimension of the Classical Domain state space consists of two parts:

$$\dim(\Omega_C) = \dim(K_C) + \dim(S_C)$$

where:
- $`\dim(K_C) = |K_C|`$ is the dimension of classical knowledge (finite discrete)
- $`\dim(S_C) = \aleph_1`$ is the dimension of classical entropy (continuous infinite)

The dimension of an observer is related to the ratio of its classical knowledge and entropy:

$$D_{\text{observer}} \propto \frac{\dim(K_C)}{\dim(S_C)} \sim \frac{I(K_C)}{I(S_C)}$$

## Classical Domain Dynamics

The dynamics of classical systems are described by Hamilton's equations or the equivalent Lagrangian equations:

Hamilton's equations:
$$\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}$$

Lagrangian equations:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0$$

where $`H`$ is the Hamiltonian, and $`L`$ is the Lagrangian, related through the Legendre transformation:

$$H(q,p) = \sum_i p_i\dot{q}_i - L(q,\dot{q})$$

### Classical Lyapunov Exponent

The dynamical stability of classical systems is described through the Lyapunov exponent:

$$\lambda = \lim_{t\to\infty} \lim_{\delta Z(0) \to 0} \frac{1}{t} \ln \frac{|\delta Z(t)|}{|\delta Z(0)|}$$

where $`\delta Z(t)`$ is the deviation of trajectories in phase space.

The main characteristic of classical chaotic systems is a positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating that tiny initial differences will be exponentially amplified.

### Classical Free Energy and Equilibrium

The thermodynamic stability of the Classical Domain is described through free energy:

$$F_C = E_{\text{classical}} - T_{\Omega_C}(S_C)$$

The relationship between free energy change and equilibrium:

$$\frac{dF_C}{dt} \leq 0, \quad \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\frac{dF_C}{dt} = 0$$

At equilibrium, the principle of detailed balance applies to the transition probabilities in the Classical Domain:

$$p_i W_{i \rightarrow j} = p_j W_{j \rightarrow i}, \quad \forall i,j$$

## Classical Domain Interactions

### Field Theory Description

Interactions in the Classical Domain are described through field theory:

$$S_{\text{classical}} = \int d^4x \mathcal{L}_{\text{classical}}(\phi(x), \partial_\mu\phi(x))$$

where $`\mathcal{L}_{\text{classical}}`$ is the classical Lagrangian density.

Classical field equations:
$$\frac{\delta S_{\text{classical}}}{\delta \phi(x)} = 0$$

Classical description of the gravitational field (Einstein's field equations):

$$R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$$

Classical description of the electromagnetic field (Maxwell's equations):

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0, \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$

### Information Transfer in Interactions

Interactions in the Classical Domain are essentially processes of information transfer:

$$I_{A \rightarrow B} = \eta_{\text{transfer}} \cdot I_A - S_{\text{transfer loss}}$$

where $`\eta_{\text{transfer}}`$ is the transfer efficiency, and $`S_{\text{transfer loss}}`$ is the entropy increase.

Information transfer speed does not exceed the speed of light:

$$v_{\text{information}} \leq c$$

The principle of locality ensures that information transfer requires a medium:

$$I_{A \rightarrow B} = 0, \text{ if } A \text{ and } B \text{ have no medium connection}$$

## Classical Information Propagation

Information propagation in the Classical Domain has the following characteristics:

### Independent Deep Copy Mechanism

Classical knowledge propagation adopts independent deep copy (not reference or pointer):

$$I_{\text{classical knowledge A}} \rightarrow I_{\text{classical knowledge B (copy)}} + S_{\text{propagation entropy (increase)}}$$

The copying process is necessarily accompanied by entropy increase:

$$\Delta S_{\text{total}} \geq \frac{k_B \ln 2}{E_{\text{copy}}} \cdot I_{\text{copied}}$$

### Redundant Encoding

Classical information propagation improves reliability through redundant encoding:

$$R_{\text{redundancy}} = \frac{I_{\text{sent}}}{I_{\text{effective}}}$$

Shannon's channel capacity theorem limits the information transmission rate in a channel:

$$C = W\log_2(1 + \frac{S}{N})$$

where $`W`$ is the bandwidth, and $`S/N`$ is the signal-to-noise ratio.

### Classical Information Diffusion Equation

The diffusion of classical information in space satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial I(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t} = D_I \nabla^2 I(\mathbf{r},t) - \gamma I(\mathbf{r},t) + S_I(\mathbf{r},t)$$

where:
- $`D_I`$ is the information diffusion coefficient
- $`\gamma`$ is the information decay rate
- $`S_I`$ is the information source term

## Classical Measurement Theory

The classical measurement process can be represented as a conditional probability:

$$P(m|s) = \text{probability of measurement value } m \text{ given system state } s$$

Ideal classical measurements have determinism:

$$P(m|s) = \delta_{m,f(s)}$$

where $`f(s)`$ is a deterministic function from system state to measurement value.

### Measurement Uncertainty

Actual classical measurements are limited by instrument precision:

$$P(m|s) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(m-f(s))^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

where $`\sigma`$ is the measurement uncertainty.

Entropy increase in the measurement process:

$$\Delta S_{\text{measurement}} \geq k_B \ln 2 \cdot I_{\text{acquired}}$$

### Classical Observer Effect

The observer effect in classical measurements (measurement disturbance):

$$\Delta s_{\text{disturbance}} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{m \cdot \Delta x_{\text{instrument}}}$$

This effect is usually negligible in macroscopic systems but becomes significant in mesoscopic systems.

## Classical Complexity Theory

Complexity in classical systems can be quantified through various measures:

### Kolmogorov Complexity

The algorithmic complexity of a classical state:

$$K(s) = \text{length of the shortest program that outputs } s$$

Relationship with entropy:
$$\langle K(s) \rangle \approx S_C + O(1)$$

### Computational Complexity

Resources required to solve classical problems:

$$C_{\text{time}}(n) = O(f(n)), \quad C_{\text{space}}(n) = O(g(n))$$

Hierarchical structure of complexity classes:
$$P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE \subseteq EXP$$

### Logical Depth

The computational resources required to reconstruct a state from its most compressed description:

$$D(s) = \text{execution time of the shortest program that outputs } s$$

Complex organized systems have high logical depth, distinguishing them from both random and simple orderly systems.

## Classical Emergent Phenomena

The Classical Domain exhibits emergent phenomena at different scales:

### Emergent Laws

Higher-level laws emerge from lower-level interactions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{higher}} \approx f(\mathcal{L}_{\text{lower}}, \text{boundary conditions}, \text{constraints})$$

Examples include thermodynamics emerging from statistical mechanics, and fluid dynamics emerging from molecular motion.

### Self-organization

Classical systems can self-organize into ordered patterns:

$$S_{\text{final}} < S_{\text{initial}} \text{ locally}, \quad S_{\text{environment-final}} > S_{\text{environment-initial}}$$

Critical self-organization conditions:
- Open system (energy/information exchange)
- Non-linear interactions
- Far from equilibrium
- Local positive feedback and global negative feedback

### Hierarchical Structures

The Classical Domain naturally forms hierarchical structures:

$$\mathcal{H} = \{L_1, L_2, ..., L_n, \mathcal{E}\}$$

where $`L_i`$ are levels, and $`\mathcal{E}`$ are inter-level connections.

Information flow between levels:
$$I_{L_i \rightarrow L_{i+1}} = \sum_j T_{ij} \cdot I_j^{L_i} - S_{\text{level transition}}$$

## Classical Domain Constraints

The Classical Domain operates under several fundamental constraints:

### Second Law of Thermodynamics

Entropy never decreases in isolated systems:

$$\Delta S_C \geq 0 \text{ for isolated systems}$$

Information erasure requires energy:
$$E_{\text{erasure}} \geq k_B T \ln 2 \cdot I_{\text{erased}}$$

### Relativity Constraints

Causality is preserved in the Classical Domain:
$$t_{\text{effect}} > t_{\text{cause}} \text{ in all reference frames}$$

Light cone separation:
$$\Delta s^2 = c^2\Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2$$

Causal connections only exist for $`\Delta s^2 > 0`$.

### Information Speed Limit

Maximum information transfer rate:

$$\frac{dI}{dt} \leq \frac{P}{k_B T \ln 2}$$

where $`P`$ is power.

Speed-bandwidth product constraint:
$$v \cdot B \leq c \cdot B_{\text{max}}$$

where $`B`$ is bandwidth, and $`B_{\text{max}}`$ is maximum possible bandwidth.

### Computational Tractability

Not all mathematically well-defined problems are tractably solvable:

$$P \neq NP \text{ (conjectured)}$$

Even in principle, some problems require computational resources exceeding the universe's capacity:
$$C_{\text{require}} > C_{\text{universe}} = \frac{E_{\text{universe}} \cdot T_{\text{universe}}}{h}$$

## Verification through Experimental Predictions

The Classical Domain theory makes several experimentally verifiable predictions:

### Measurement Precision Limit

The fundamental limit on measurement precision:

$$\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \text{ (quantum limit)}$$

$$\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \text{ (energy-time uncertainty)}$$

These limits manifest in high-precision measurements, even in seemingly classical systems.

### Classical Information Erasure

Experimental verification of Landauer's principle:

$$E_{\text{erasure}} = k_B T \ln 2 \text{ per bit (minimum)}$$

Recent experiments have confirmed this relationship to within a few percent accuracy.

### Emergence Testing

Predictive power of emergent laws compared to reductionist approaches:

$$P_{\text{emergent}} = \frac{A_{\text{emergent}}}{C_{\text{emergent}}} > \frac{A_{\text{reductionist}}}{C_{\text{reductionist}}} = P_{\text{reductionist}}$$

where $`A`$ is accuracy and $`C`$ is computational cost, demonstrating the efficiency of emergent descriptions.

### Classical-Classical Interface Experiments

Testing the interface between different classical regimes (e.g., quantum-classical transition regime):

$$\tau_{\text{transition}} \propto N^{\alpha} \cdot T^{-\beta}$$

where $`N`$ is system size, $`T`$ is temperature, and $`\alpha, \beta`$ are scaling exponents.

These experiments reveal how classical behavior itself emerges at different scales and energy regimes.
