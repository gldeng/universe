# Research Highlights

## Information Ontology: Rewriting the Foundations of Physics

### Key Contributions

1. **Paradigm-Shifting Foundation**
   - Introduces information as the ontological primitive of reality, more fundamental than matter or energy
   - Establishes XOR and SHIFT as the basic operations from which all physical phenomena emerge
   - Provides a coherent alternative to both wave-particle and field-based ontologies

2. **Quantum Mechanics Reformulation**
   - Resolves the measurement problem by reframing observation as information extraction
   - Explains quantum superposition as information overlay without wave function collapse postulates
   - Derives quantum probabilities naturally from information principles
   - Clarifies quantum entanglement as information connection independent of spatial constraints

3. **Relativistic Physics Reinterpretation**
   - Derives spacetime as an emergent structure from information relationships
   - Reframes gravity as information density gradients rather than spacetime curvature
   - Provides a coherent explanation of black hole physics without information loss

4. **Unification Framework**
   - Bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity through common information principles
   - Derives a unified field equation incorporating both quantum and gravitational effects
   - Resolves long-standing theoretical incompatibilities through information-based approach

5. **Experimental Predictions**
   - Provides specific, quantitative predictions for quantum system behavior
   - Identifies measurable gravitational wave modifications
   - Proposes detectable signatures in black hole radiation spectra
   - Outlines laboratory tests feasible with current or near-future technology
