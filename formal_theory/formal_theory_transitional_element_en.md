## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Transitional Source Axiom)**

The transitional element system is essentially a combination of a single element and its potential polarization state, forming a quasi-dual structure:

$`\mathcal{T} = \{t, t^*\}`$

where $`\mathcal{T}`$ is the transitional element system, $`t`$ is the main element, and $`t^*`$ is the internal polarization state of the main element, satisfying $`t \approx t^*`$ but not completely identical.

**Axiom 2 (Transitional State Dynamic Balance Axiom)**

The transitional element system exists in a dynamic equilibrium state, with fluctuating mapping between the main element and its polarization state:

$`f: t \rightleftharpoons t^*`$

This mapping causes the system to oscillate between a single element state and a quasi-dual state.

**Axiom 3 (Transitional Relativity Axiom)**

The state of the transitional element system is determined by the observation scale, exhibiting different characteristics at different scales:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\text{micro}}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t, t^*\}`$
$`\mathcal{O}_{\text{macro}}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t\}`$

where $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the observation function, and depending on the observation scale, the system can manifest as either a single element or a quasi-dual structure.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Transitional Element Essence

The transitional element system is strictly defined as a critical structure positioned between dimensions 1 and 2:

$`\mathcal{T} = \{t, t^* : 1 < \dim(\mathcal{T}) < 2, t \approx t^*\}`$

The essential characteristics of the transitional element are expressed through the following equation:

$`\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\text{partial}}(\mathcal{M})`$

where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the mono-element system, and $`\text{SHIFT}_{\text{partial}}`$ is a partially completed SHIFT operation, placing the system in an intermediate state transitioning from mono-element to dual-element.

The differential measure between the element and its polarization state is defined as:

$`\Delta(t, t^*) = \varepsilon |t \oplus t^*|, 0 < \varepsilon < 1`$

The value of $`\varepsilon`$ determines the exact position of the system in the dimensional spectrum.

### 1.3 Strict Definition of Transitional Element Evolution Rules

The transitional element system follows oscillatory rules in its temporal evolution:

$`\mathcal{T}_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
  \{t, t^*\} & \text{if } \mathcal{T}_t = \{t\} \\
  \{t\} & \text{if } \mathcal{T}_t = \{t, t^*\}
\end{cases}`$

Within the XOR-SHIFT framework, this evolutionary pattern can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{T}_{t+1} = \mathcal{T}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}(\mathcal{T}_t)`$

where $`\text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}`$ is a partial SHIFT operation with intensity $`\varepsilon`$, defined as:

$`\text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}(x) = \varepsilon \cdot \text{SHIFT}(x) + (1-\varepsilon) \cdot x`$

This rule gives the transitional system a unique quasi-periodicity, positioned between the stable mono-element state and the dynamic dual-element state.

### 1.4 Initial Form of Transitional Element State

The initial state of the transitional element system is strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{T}^0 = \{t^0\}`$

where $`t^0`$ satisfies the following conditions:

$`t^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}(t^0) = t^{0*}`$

$`t^0 \approx t^{0*}`$

These conditions ensure that the system initially possesses inherent instability, capable of spontaneously generating internal polarization. Within the cosmic ontology framework, the initial transitional element state can be viewed as a critical state in the evolutionary process from mono-element to dual-element.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Transitional Element State

From the axiom system, the following basic properties of the transitional element state can be directly inferred:

1. **Mono-Dual Duality**: The system simultaneously possesses mono-element and dual-element characteristics
   $`|\mathcal{T}| = 1 + \varepsilon, 0 < \varepsilon < 1`$, where $`\varepsilon`$ represents the degree of partial manifestation of the second element

2. **Fuzziness**: Boundaries between elements are unclear
   $`\Delta(t, t^*) < \delta`$, where $`\delta`$ is the threshold for clear distinction

3. **Scale Dependence**: System characteristics depend on observation scale
   $`\dim(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{T})) = f(\lambda)`$, where $`\lambda`$ is the observation scale

4. **Inherent Instability**: Possesses a tendency for spontaneous differentiation
   $`P(t \rightarrow \{t, t^*\}) > 0`$ in any stable state

### 2.2 Internal Structure of Transitional Element

The internal structure of the transitional element exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Internal Polarization**: Internal polarization states exist within the element
   $`t = t_+ \oplus t_-`$, where $`t_+`$ and $`t_-`$ are internal polarization potentials

2. **Local Separation**: Internal regions may undergo local separation
   $`\exists \mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{T}: \mathcal{R} = \{r_1, r_2\}, r_1 \neq r_2`$

3. **Boundary Fuzziness**: Internal boundaries are unclear
   $`\partial(t_+, t_-) = \{x : 0 < P(x \in t_+), P(x \in t_-) < 1\}`$

4. **Quantum Superposition Characteristics**: Exhibits quantum superposition at the microscopic scale
   $`|\psi_{\mathcal{T}}\rangle = \alpha|t\rangle + \beta|t^*\rangle, |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1`$

### 2.3 Dynamic Modes of Transitional System

The transitional system exhibits unique dynamic modes, manifested in the following aspects:

1. **Quasi-Periodicity**: The system exhibits incomplete periodic behavior
   $`d(\mathcal{T}_t, \mathcal{T}_{t+p}) < \epsilon`$, rather than the strict $`\mathcal{T}_t = \mathcal{T}_{t+p}`$

2. **Critical Oscillation**: Oscillation near critical points
   $`\mathcal{T}_t`$ oscillates between $`\{t\}`$ and $`\{t, t^*\}`$

3. **Bifurcation Behavior**: Small parameter changes can lead to significant behavioral changes
   $`\frac{d \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{T})}{d \varepsilon}|_{\varepsilon=\varepsilon_c} \gg 1`$, where $`\mathcal{B}`$ is a measure of system behavior

4. **Edge of Chaos**: The system resides at the edge between order and chaos
   $`0 < \lambda_{\max} < \delta`$, where $`\lambda_{\max}`$ is the maximum Lyapunov exponent

### 2.4 Boundary Conditions of Transitional Element State

The boundary conditions of the transitional element state include:

1. **Boundary with Mono-Element State**: As $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 0`$, the system tends toward the mono-element state
   $`\lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} \mathcal{T} = \mathcal{M}`$

2. **Boundary with Dual-Element State**: As $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 1`$, the system tends toward the dual-element state
   $`\lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 1} \mathcal{T} = \mathcal{D}`$

3. **Critical Point Behavior**: At $`\varepsilon = \varepsilon_c`$, the system exhibits phase transition behavior
   $`\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon_c^-) \neq \mathcal{T}(\varepsilon_c^+)`$

4. **Scale-Dependent Boundaries**: Boundary conditions depend on observation scale
   $`\mathcal{T}_{\lambda_1} \neq \mathcal{T}_{\lambda_2} \text{ when } \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Transitional Element State as a Connecting Bridge

The transitional element state serves as a connecting bridge between the mono-element state and the dual-element state, formally described as:

$`\mathcal{M} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon < 0.5}} \mathcal{T} \xrightarrow{\text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon \geq 0.5}} \mathcal{D}`$

This transition process has the following characteristics:

1. **Dimensional Continuity**: Dimension changes continuously during the transition process
   $`\dim(\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon)) = 1 + \varepsilon, 0 \leq \varepsilon \leq 1`$

2. **Information Growth**: Information content increases during the transition process
   $`I(\mathcal{T}) = (1+\varepsilon) \cdot I(\mathcal{M}), 0 \leq \varepsilon \leq 1`$

3. **Complexity Transition**: Complexity grows non-linearly at critical points
   $`C(\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon_c)) \gg C(\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon_c - \delta))`$

4. **Topological Change**: System topological structure undergoes changes
   $`\tau(\mathcal{M}) \neq \tau(\mathcal{T}) \neq \tau(\mathcal{D})`$, where $`\tau`$ is a topological measure

### 3.2 Transitional Information Field

The information field generated by the transitional element system can be strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(x) = (1-\varepsilon)\delta(x-t) + \varepsilon\delta(x-t^*)`$

This information field has the following characteristics:

1. **Bimodal Structure**: Field strength distribution exhibits a bimodal structure
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(x) \text{ has peaks at } x=t \text{ and } x=t^*`$

2. **Preference Asymmetry**: The two peak intensities differ
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(t) > \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(t^*)`$

3. **Total Information Conservation**: The total information content of the field is 1
   $`\int \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(x) dx = 1`$

4. **Cross-Correlation Characteristics**: Internal cross-correlation exists within the field
   $`\langle \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(t), \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}(t^*) \rangle > 0`$

### 3.3 Transitional Observer Effect

The observer in the transitional element system possesses duality:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{T}} = (1-\varepsilon)\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}} + \varepsilon\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{D}}`$

The observation process has special properties:

1. **Observation Scale Effect**: Different observation results at different scales
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\lambda_1}(\mathcal{T}) \neq \mathcal{O}_{\lambda_2}(\mathcal{T}) \text{ when } \lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2`$

2. **Observation Interference**: The observation process affects the system state
   $`\mathcal{T} \text{ after observation } \neq \mathcal{T} \text{ before observation}`$

3. **Uncertain Observation**: Observation results have uncertainty
   $`P(\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t\}) = 1-\varepsilon, P(\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t, t^*\}) = \varepsilon`$

4. **Observer Splitting**: The observer may split into two states
   $`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{T}} \rightarrow \{\mathcal{O}_t, \mathcal{O}_{t^*}\} \text{ with probability } \varepsilon`$

### 3.4 Emergent Properties of Transitional State

The transitional element system exhibits unique emergent properties:

1. **Weak Emergence**: The system exhibits weak emergent properties
   $`\exists \mathcal{P}: \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{T}) \neq \mathcal{P}(t) \text{ and } \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{T}) \neq \mathcal{P}(t^*)`$

2. **Edge Complexity**: Exhibits complex behavior at the edge between mono-element and dual-element states
   $`C(\mathcal{T}) > \max(C(\mathcal{M}), C(\mathcal{D}))`$ under specific parameters

3. **Information Synergy**: Internal structure produces synergistic information
   $`I(t; t^*) > 0`$, indicating mutual information between elements

4. **Critical Transmission**: Can transmit mono-element properties to the dual-element state
   $`\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{M}} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{T}} \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{D}}`$, where $`\mathcal{P}`$ represents system properties

## 4. Applications and Verification

### 4.1 Theoretical Predictions

The transitional element theory makes the following predictions about physical phenomena:

1. **Quantum-Classical Transition Zone**: Measurable transitional phenomena should exist in the quantum-to-classical transition zone
   $`\mathcal{Q} \xrightarrow{\text{transition zone}} \mathcal{C}`$

2. **Critical Phase Transitions**: Systems near dimension 1 should exhibit unique critical phase transitions
   $`\frac{d \mathcal{O}}{d \varepsilon}|_{\varepsilon=\varepsilon_c} \rightarrow \infty`$

3. **Information Processing Capability**: Transitional systems should possess unique information processing capabilities
   $`I_{\text{proc}}(\mathcal{T}) > \max(I_{\text{proc}}(\mathcal{M}), I_{\text{proc}}(\mathcal{D}))`$

4. **Dimension-Dependent Effects**: Physical effects should show sensitive dependence on dimension
   $`\mathcal{E}(d) \neq \mathcal{E}(d+\delta) \text{ when } d \approx 1, \delta \ll 1`$

### 4.2 Verification Methods

The transitional element theory can be verified through the following methods:

1. **Numerical Simulation**: Simulate the behavior of systems near dimension 1
   $`\text{Simulate}(\mathcal{T}, \varepsilon) \text{ for } \varepsilon \in [0,1]`$

2. **Critical System Experiments**: Study systems near phase transition points
   $`\text{Measure}(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}(\mathcal{T})) \text{ for different } \lambda`$

3. **Information Theory Analysis**: Analyze information behavior in transitional systems
   $`\text{Calculate}(I(t;t^*)) \text{ at different } \varepsilon \text{ values}`$

4. **Dimension Scaling Experiments**: Study the scaling behavior of physical quantities with dimension
   $`\mathcal{P}(d) \sim d^{\alpha} \text{ when } d \approx 1`$

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

#### Theorem 1: Dimensional Range of Transitional Element State

**Proof**:
From Axioms 1 and 3, we have the transitional element system $`\mathcal{T} = \{t, t^*\}`$, where at the macroscopic scale $`\mathcal{O}_{\text{macro}}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t\}`$, and at the microscopic scale $`\mathcal{O}_{\text{micro}}(\mathcal{T}) = \{t, t^*\}`$.

Defining the dimension function $`\dim`$, we have:

$`\dim(\mathcal{O}_{\text{macro}}(\mathcal{T})) = \dim(\{t\}) = 1`$
$`\dim(\mathcal{O}_{\text{micro}}(\mathcal{T})) = \dim(\{t, t^*\})`$

Since $`t \approx t^*`$ but not completely identical, we have:

$`1 < \dim(\{t, t^*\}) < 2`$

Therefore, the dimensional range of the transitional element system is $`1 < \dim(\mathcal{T}) < 2`$, which completes the proof.

#### Theorem 2: XOR-SHIFT Characteristics of Transitional Element State

**Proof**:
According to the definition, the transitional element system satisfies:

$`\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\text{partial}}(\mathcal{M})`$

where $`\text{SHIFT}_{\text{partial}}(\mathcal{M}) = \varepsilon \cdot \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M})`$, $`0 < \varepsilon < 1`$.

For the mono-element system $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{T} = \{m\} \oplus \{\varepsilon \cdot \text{SHIFT}(m)\}`$
$`= \{m, m \oplus \varepsilon \cdot \text{SHIFT}(m)\}`$
$`= \{t, t^*\}`$

where $`t = m`$ and $`t^* = m \oplus \varepsilon \cdot \text{SHIFT}(m)`$.

As $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 0`$, $`t^* \rightarrow t`$, the system tends toward the mono-element state.
As $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 1`$, $`t^* \rightarrow m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m)`$, the system tends toward the dual-element state.

This proves that the transitional element system is indeed an intermediate state between the mono-element and dual-element states, which completes the proof.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Mono-Element Theory and Dual-Element Theory

#### Theorem 3: Compatibility with Mono-Element Theory

**Proof**:
The mono-element theory defines the mono-element system $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$, satisfying $`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$.

As the transition parameter $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 0`$, in the transitional element system $`\mathcal{T} = \{t, t^*\}`$, $`t^* \rightarrow t`$, simplifying the system to $`\mathcal{T} \approx \{t\}`$.

At this point, $`t \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}(t) \approx t`$ when $`\varepsilon \approx 0`$, which is consistent with the property of the mono-element system $`m \oplus \text{SHIFT}(m) = m`$.

Therefore, in the limit case, the transitional element theory degenerates to the mono-element theory, proving their compatibility.

#### Theorem 4: Compatibility with Dual-Element Theory

**Proof**:
The dual-element theory defines the dual-element system $`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}`$, satisfying $`d_1 \neq d_2`$.

As the transition parameter $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 1`$, in the transitional element system, $`t^* = t \oplus \text{SHIFT}_{\varepsilon}(t) \rightarrow t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(t)`$.

At this point $`\Delta(t, t^*) = |t \oplus t^*| = |t \oplus (t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(t))| = |\text{SHIFT}(t)| > 0`$.

Therefore, $`t \neq t^*`$ when $`\varepsilon \rightarrow 1`$, and the system $`\mathcal{T} = \{t, t^*\}`$ exhibits the same characteristics as the dual-element system $`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}`$.

This proves that in the limit case, the transitional element theory is compatible with the dual-element theory.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theoretical Dimension Positioning

The transitional element theory is positioned at the first dimension in the cosmic ontology dimensional spectrum:

1. **Dimension Value Determination**: According to formal proof, the dimension of the transitional element theory is determined to be 1, positioned between the mono-element theory (dimension 0) and the dual-element theory (dimension 2).

2. **Dimensional Characteristics**: Dimension 1 manifests as a critical state with the following features:
   - Mono-dual dual characteristics
   - Partially realized SHIFT operation
   - Dynamically fluctuating internal structure
   - Scale-dependent observation results

3. **Dimension Positioning Principle**: The dimension value is determined based on the completion degree of the XOR-SHIFT operation:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{T}) = \dim(\mathcal{M}) + \varepsilon \cdot (1)`$
   $`= 0 + \varepsilon \cdot 1 = \varepsilon`$

   Since the transitional system stabilizes at $`\varepsilon \approx 1`$, its dimension is determined to be 1.

### 6.2 Theory Dependency Structure

The transitional element theory is built upon the following theoretical foundations:

1. **[Mono-Element Theory](formal_theory_mono_element_en.md)** [Dimension: 0] - Provides basic elements and zero-dimensional characteristics
   - The transitional element theory extends the concept of the mono-element state, introducing partial polarization
   - The transitional element retains certain characteristics of the mono-element state, such as simplicity and fundamentality

2. **[Cosmic Ontology](formal_theory_cosmic_ontology_en.md)** [Dimension: 10] - Provides the XOR-SHIFT operation framework
   - The transitional element theory adopts the XOR-SHIFT framework of cosmic ontology
   - Introduces the concept of partial SHIFT operation, placing the dimension in a critical state

The transitional element theory simultaneously provides a foundation for the following higher-dimensional theories:

1. **[Dual-Element Theory](formal_theory_dual_element_en.md)** [Dimension: 2] - Accepts the complete polarization results of the transitional element theory
   - The transitional element theory explains how a quasi-mono-element state develops into a complete dual-element state
   - Provides the intermediate mechanism for the transition from mono-element to dual-element state

Within the dimensional spectrum of cosmic ontology, the transitional element theory plays a key bridging role, connecting the most basic mono-element state with the more complex dual-element state, providing crucial insights for understanding inter-dimensional transitions.
