### Title
XOR-SHIFT Operations Unifying Quantum and Relativistic Frameworks

### Abstract
We introduce XOR-SHIFT operations as a unifying foundation for quantum mechanics and general relativity. This information-theoretic framework reinterprets fundamental physical principles through an ontological perspective where information differentials and transformations constitute reality's essence. Our formalism demonstrates mathematically rigorous connections between quantum superposition and relativistic reference frames through XOR (information difference) and SHIFT (state transformation) operations. We provide verifiable predictions, including novel quantum measurement preservation signatures, distinctive gravitational wave polarization patterns, and quantum-classical boundary oscillations. This approach offers a path to resolving long-standing incompatibilities between quantum mechanics and general relativity by establishing a common mathematical language based on information primitives.
