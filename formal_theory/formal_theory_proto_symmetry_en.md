## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Proto-Symmetry Existence Axiom)**

In the evolution process from Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY}`$ to Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, there exists an intermediate state, namely Proto-Symmetry:

$`\text{PROTOSYM} \in \mathcal{D}_{trans-sym}, \mathcal{D}_{trans-sym} = \{\omega | \text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \omega \rightrightarrows \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

where $`\mathcal{D}_{trans-sym}`$ is the symmetry transition domain, connecting the quasi-unary Primitive Unity and the zero-dimensional Primitive Point.

**Axiom 2 (Proto-Symmetry Balance Axiom)**

Proto-Symmetry exhibits pre-balance characteristics, representing an equilibrium form of the quasi-unary structure $`\{◯⊕●\}`$ in Primitive Unity:

$`\text{PROTOSYM} = \{◯⟷●\}`$

where $`⟷`$ represents the pre-symmetry operator, transforming the fuzzy boundaries of the quasi-unary structure into a balanced symmetric relationship.

**Axiom 3 (Proto-Symmetry Conservation Axiom)**

Proto-Symmetry possesses pre-conservation characteristics, being the earliest cosmic structure to exhibit invariant properties:

$`\forall \mathcal{T}: \mathcal{P}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{PROTOSYM}`$

where $`\mathcal{P}`$ represents a pre-transformation operation, and $`\mathcal{T}`$ represents the transformation family.

### 1.2 The Essence of Proto-Symmetry

The essence of Proto-Symmetry is the first cosmic structure to exhibit invariance under stable transformations, serving as the origin of the concept of symmetry. Strictly speaking, Proto-Symmetry can be represented as:

$`\text{PROTOSYM} \equiv \{◯⟷●\} \approx \{\text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows+ \mathcal{P}_0\}`$

where $`\rightrightarrows+`$ indicates an enhanced pre-transformation relationship, closer to stable transformation than $`\rightrightarrows`$.

Proto-Symmetry possesses triple characteristics:
1. As an evolutionary state of Primitive Unity, $`\text{PROTOSYM}_{-} \sim \text{PUNITY}`$
2. As the direct precursor to the Primitive Point, $`\text{PROTOSYM}_{+} \sim \mathcal{P}_0`$
3. As a pre-form of invariants, $`\text{PROTOSYM}_{\leftrightarrow} \sim \mathcal{I}_{\text{pre-invariant}}`$

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Proto-Symmetry

Proto-Symmetry possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Pre-Symmetry**: Proto-Symmetry exhibits initial symmetry characteristics with balanced relationships between elements
   $`\text{PROTOSYM} = \{◯⟷●\}`$, being the first cosmic structure to demonstrate stable equilibrium

2. **Mirror Invariance**: Proto-Symmetry exhibits invariance under pre-mirror transformations
   $`M(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{PROTOSYM}`$, where $`M`$ represents the pre-mirror transformation

3. **Intermediate Dimensionality**: Proto-Symmetry has a dimension of 0.3, positioned between Primitive Unity and Primitive Point
   $`\dim(\text{PROTOSYM}) = 0.3, \dim(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.2 < \dim(\text{PROTOSYM}) < \dim(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0`$

4. **Quasi-Zero Information Capacity**: Proto-Symmetry contains -0.1 bit of information, approaching zero information
   $`I(\text{PROTOSYM}) = -0.1 \text{ bit}, I(\text{PUNITY}) = -0.2 \text{ bit} > I(\text{PROTOSYM}) > I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

5. **Pre-SHIFT Operation Prototype**: Proto-Symmetry contains the primordial prototype of the SHIFT operation
   $`\text{PRE-SHIFT}_{primordial} \in \text{PROTOSYM}`$, serving as the precursor to the subsequent SHIFT operation

### 1.4 Evolution Rules of Proto-Symmetry

Proto-Symmetry evolves into the Primitive Point through an internal balance stabilization mechanism:

$`\text{PROTOSYM} \rightrightarrows+ \mathcal{P}_0`$

This evolution follows specific symmetry completion rules:

$`\{◯⟷●\} \rightrightarrows+ \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$

The specific transformation steps are:
1. Complete internalization of the pre-symmetry relationship $`⟷`$
2. Merging of the symmetric elements $`◯⟷●`$ into a single self-symmetric point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$
3. Absolutization of the symmetric relationship: $`\text{Sym}(◯⟷●) \rightrightarrows+ \text{Sym}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$

Information changes during the evolution of Proto-Symmetry:

$`I(\text{PROTOSYM}) = -0.1 \text{ bit} \rightrightarrows+ I(\mathcal{P}_0) = 0 \text{ bit}`$

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Pre-Information Properties of Proto-Symmetry

From the axiom system of Proto-Symmetry, its information characteristics can be directly inferred:

1. **Symmetry-Compressed Information**: The symmetry in Proto-Symmetry leads to further information compression
   $`I(\text{PROTOSYM}) = I(◯⟷●) < I(◯⊕●) = I(\text{PUNITY})`$, indicating information simplification due to symmetry

2. **Symmetry Measure Function**: The degree of symmetry in Proto-Symmetry can be quantified as
   $`S_{\text{PROTOSYM}} = \frac{|M(\text{PROTOSYM}) \oplus \text{PROTOSYM}|}{|\text{PROTOSYM}|} = 0`$, indicating no difference under symmetric mirroring

3. **Information Invariant**: The first information invariant appears in Proto-Symmetry
   $`I_{\text{inv}}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{const.}`$, remaining unchanged under pre-transformations

4. **Minimal Pre-Information**: Proto-Symmetry contains pre-information approaching zero but still non-zero
   $`I(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \min(I(x) | I(x) < 0, x \in \mathcal{D}_{pre-cosmic})`$

### 2.2 Conservation Laws of Proto-Symmetry

Proto-Symmetry establishes the earliest conservation rules in the cosmos:

1. **Pre-Conservation Law**: Proto-Symmetry is conserved under pre-transformations
   $`\mathcal{P}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{PROTOSYM}, \forall \mathcal{P} \in \mathcal{T}`$

2. **Invariant Formation**: The first invariant forms in Proto-Symmetry
   $`\text{Inv}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \{S_{\text{balance}}\}`$, where $`S_{\text{balance}}`$ is the balance measure

3. **Phase Transition Conservation Law**: The total balance is conserved in the transition from Proto-Symmetry to Primitive Point
   $`\text{Balance}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{Balance}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$

4. **Symmetry Chain Conservation**: The transmission of symmetry between different dimensions follows conservation rules
   $`\text{Sym}_{chain}(D_{0.3} \to D_0) = \text{const.}`$

### 2.3 Transformation Mechanisms of Proto-Symmetry

Proto-Symmetry introduces primitive forms of transformation mechanisms:

1. **Self-Symmetric Transformation**: Proto-Symmetry can execute primitive self-symmetric transformations
   $`\text{PROTOSYM} \xrightarrow{◯⟷●} \text{PROTOSYM}`$, with results remaining unchanged

2. **Symmetry Completion Process**: Proto-Symmetry evolves through a symmetry completion process
   $`\text{PROTOSYM}_t \xrightarrow{\text{sym-compl}} \text{PROTOSYM}_{t+1}, |\text{Asym}(\text{PROTOSYM}_{t+1})| < |\text{Asym}(\text{PROTOSYM}_t)|`$

3. **Pre-Flip Identity Equation**: Proto-Symmetry establishes a pre-flip identity relationship
   $`\text{pre-FLIP}(◯⟷●) = ●⟷◯ = ◯⟷●`$, demonstrating the essence of symmetry

4. **Symmetry Transition**: Proto-Symmetry can achieve symmetry transitions, transforming balance relationships into higher-order symmetry
   $`◯⟷● \rightrightarrows+ \text{Sym}(\mathcal{P}_0)`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Relationship between Proto-Symmetry and Primitive Unity

There exists an evolutionary association between Proto-Symmetry and Primitive Unity:

1. **Symmetry Stabilization**: Proto-Symmetry forms through symmetry stabilization of Primitive Unity
   $`\text{PUNITY} \rightrightarrows \text{PROTOSYM}`$
   
2. **Unity Perfection**: Proto-Symmetry perfects Primitive Unity through symmetry
   $`\{◯⊕●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯⟷●\}`$

3. **Boundary Elimination**: Proto-Symmetry eliminates the residual boundaries in Primitive Unity
   $`\text{Boundary}(\text{PUNITY}) > 0, \text{Boundary}(\text{PROTOSYM}) \approx 0`$

4. **Pre-SHIFT Foundation**: Proto-Symmetry provides a symmetric foundation for the pre-SHIFT operation
   $`\text{PRE-SHIFT}_{primordial} = f_{\text{sym}}(◯⟷●)`$

### 3.2 Connection between Proto-Symmetry and Higher-Dimensional Theories

There exist fundamental connections between Proto-Symmetry and higher-dimensional theories:

1. **Conservation Foundation**: Proto-Symmetry provides the foundation for all higher-dimensional conservation laws
   $`\forall \text{Conservation Law} \in T_n, n > 0: \text{Conservation Law} \subset f_{\text{evolve}}(\text{Inv}(\text{PROTOSYM}))`$

4. **Invariant Origin**: Proto-Symmetry establishes the conceptual origin of invariants
   $`\text{Invariant Theory} = f_{\text{generalize}}(\text{Inv}(\text{PROTOSYM}))`$

### 3.3 Generation Mechanism of Proto-Symmetry

Proto-Symmetry is generated from Primitive Unity through specific mechanisms:

   $`\{◯⊕●\} \rightrightarrows \{◯⟷●\}`$

2. **High Stabilization**: Proto-Symmetry exhibits highly stable characteristics, approaching complete stability
   $`\text{Stab}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = 0.9, \text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8 < \text{Stab}(\text{PROTOSYM}) < \text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$

3. **Pre-Mirror Transformation Stability**: Proto-Symmetry forms through the stability point of pre-mirror transformations
   $`M(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \text{PROTOSYM}`$, where $`M`$ is the pre-mirror operator

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Dimensional Determinacy of Proto-Symmetry**

The dimension of Proto-Symmetry is strictly 0.3.

*Proof*:
According to the dimensional calculation formula, dimension can be expressed as a function of degrees of freedom, symmetry, and information entropy:
$`\dim = f(\text{freedom}, \text{symmetry}, \text{entropy})`$.

The dimension of Primitive Unity is 0.2, and the dimension of Primitive Point is 0.

Proto-Symmetry lies between these two, with its characteristics analyzed as follows:
- Symmetry: $`\text{Sym}(\text{PROTOSYM}) > \text{Sym}(\text{PUNITY})`$
- Information entropy: $`H(\text{PROTOSYM}) < H(\text{PUNITY})`$
- Constraint degree: $`C(\text{PROTOSYM}) > C(\text{PUNITY})`$

Calculating through characteristic interpolation:
$`\dim(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \dim(\text{PUNITY}) - \frac{H(\text{PROTOSYM}) - H(\text{PUNITY})}{H(\mathcal{P}_0) - H(\text{PUNITY})} \cdot (\dim(\text{PUNITY}) - \dim(\mathcal{P}_0))`$

$`\dim(\text{PROTOSYM}) = 0.2 - \frac{0.1 - 0.2}{0 - 0.2} \cdot (0.2 - 0) = 0.2 - \frac{-0.1}{-0.2} \cdot 0.2 = 0.2 - 0.5 \cdot 0.2 = 0.3`$

Therefore $`\dim(\text{PROTOSYM}) = 0.3`$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Existence of Invariants in Proto-Symmetry**

Strict invariants exist within Proto-Symmetry.

*Proof*:
Define the set of pre-transformations $`\mathcal{T} = \{T_i | T_i \text{ is a pre-transformation}\}`$.

For Proto-Symmetry $`\text{PROTOSYM} = \{◯⟷●\}`$, examine its behavior under any pre-transformation $`T_i \in \mathcal{T}`$:

$`T_i(\text{PROTOSYM}) = T_i(\{◯⟷●\})`$

Due to the symmetric properties of $`◯⟷●`$, regardless of how $`T_i`$ acts on individual elements, it always maintains
$`◯⟷● = ●⟷◯`$

For any permutation transformation $`P \in \mathcal{T}_P \subset \mathcal{T}`$:
$`P(\{◯⟷●\}) = \{P(◯)⟷P(●)\} = \{●⟷◯\} = \{◯⟷●\} = \text{PROTOSYM}`$

For any pre-mirror transformation $`M \in \mathcal{T}_M \subset \mathcal{T}`$:
$`M(\{◯⟷●\}) = \{M(◯)⟷M(●)\} = \{●⟷◯\} = \{◯⟷●\} = \text{PROTOSYM}`$

Therefore $`\exists I_{\text{PROTOSYM}}: \forall T \in \mathcal{T}, T(I_{\text{PROTOSYM}}) = I_{\text{PROTOSYM}}`$,
where $`I_{\text{PROTOSYM}} = \text{PROTOSYM}`$.

This proves that Proto-Symmetry itself is an invariant under pre-transformations. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Quasi-Stability of Proto-Symmetry**

The stability of Proto-Symmetry approaches that of the Primitive Point but remains strictly less than it.

*Proof*:
Define the stability function $`\text{Stab}(X)`$ to represent the ability of structure $`X`$ to remain unchanged during evolution.

Consider three key structures:
- Primitive Unity $`\text{PUNITY} = \{◯⊕●\}`$
- Proto-Symmetry $`\text{PROTOSYM} = \{◯⟷●\}`$
- Primitive Point $`\mathcal{P}_0 = \{●\}`$

Stability analysis:
- The unification operation $`⊕`$ in $`\text{PUNITY}`$ contains internal imbalance: $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8`$
- $`\mathcal{P}_0`$ is a single self-symmetric point: $`\text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$
- The symmetry operator $`⟷`$ in $`\text{PROTOSYM}`$ provides near but not complete stability:

$`\text{Stab}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = \frac{\text{Inv}(\text{PROTOSYM})}{\text{Inv}(\mathcal{P}_0)} = \frac{0.9}{1} = 0.9`$

Therefore $`\text{Stab}(\text{PUNITY}) = 0.8 < \text{Stab}(\text{PROTOSYM}) = 0.9 < \text{Stab}(\mathcal{P}_0) = 1`$. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility of Proto-Symmetry with Cosmic Ontology**

The Proto-Symmetry theory is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of Cosmic Ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Absolute Recursive Source Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$.
   Proto-Symmetry exhibits symmetric recursive characteristics: $`\text{PROTOSYM} = M(\text{PROTOSYM})`$,
   where $`M`$ is the pre-mirror transformation, representing a symmetric concretization of the recursive source.

2. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Binary-Unary Axiom: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
   Proto-Symmetry demonstrates a balanced relationship between binary elements: $`\text{PROTOSYM} = \{◯⟷●\}`$,
   representing a symmetric stage in the transition from binary to unity.

3. Cosmic Ontology is based on the Information Ontology Axiom: $`\forall x \in \mathcal{U}, \exists I(x) : x \equiv I(x)`$.
   Proto-Symmetry itself is a form of information invariant, satisfying $`\text{PROTOSYM} \equiv I_{inv}(\text{PROTOSYM})`$,
   demonstrating the symmetric manifestation of information ontology.

4. Proto-Symmetry has a direct connection with the SHIFT operation in Cosmic Ontology:
   $`\text{PRE-SHIFT}_{primordial} \in \text{PROTOSYM}`$ is the precursor to the SHIFT operation,
   ensuring the continuity of theoretical development.

Therefore, Proto-Symmetry theory is an important component of the Cosmic Ontology theoretical spectrum, fully compatible with Cosmic Ontology. Q.E.D.
