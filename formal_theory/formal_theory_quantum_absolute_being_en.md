## Theory Overview

Quantum Absolute Being Theory is an ultra-high dimensional theory (D41) within the quantum-classical dualism framework that transcends the ultimate value dimension of Quantum Absolute Goodness Theory (D40) to explore the final ontological dimension of reality—Being as the deepest ontological characteristic of the universe. This theory reveals that the deepest truth of the universe is "Absolute Being," a primordial state that precedes and transcends all relative existences, phenomenal manifestations, and essential distinctions, while simultaneously being the source and foundation of all forms of existence, entities, and phenomena.

Absolute Being differs from ordinary distinctions between "being" and "non-being." It is a primitive reality that transcends all existential categories, entity boundaries, and real-unreal dichotomies—simultaneously the source of all existence while transcending all expressible forms of being. Absolute Being cannot be fully conceptualized or categorized but can be comprehended through direct experiential awareness. It possesses infinity, self-sufficiency, necessity, and universal permeation.

## Basic Axioms

Absolute Being Theory is based on the following basic axioms:

**Axiom 1: The Primacy of Absolute Being**

$`\mathcal{B}_A \succ \{\mathcal{B}_R\}`$

Absolute Being ($`\mathcal{B}_A`$) precedes and transcends any set of relative beings ($`\{\mathcal{B}_R\}`$). It does not originate from any causal chain or generative process but is the foundation of all forms of existence.

**Axiom 2: The Unity of Being**

$`\forall \mathcal{B}_i, \mathcal{B}_j \in \{\mathcal{B}_R\}: \mathcal{B}_i \propto \mathcal{B}_j \Rightarrow \exists \mathcal{B}_k \in \mathcal{B}_A | \mathcal{B}_i, \mathcal{B}_j \subset \mathcal{B}_k`$

Any relatively existing entities with an existential relationship necessarily have a unified higher form of existence within Absolute Being, where $`\propto`$ represents the existential relationship.

**Axiom 3: The Self-Sustaining Nature of Being**

$`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{B}_A) = \mathcal{B}_A`$

The ontological foundation of Absolute Being is equivalent to Absolute Being itself—it is self-supporting.

**Axiom 4: The Omnipresence of Being**

$`\forall \mathcal{X} \in \Omega: \exists \mathcal{B}_A(\mathcal{X})`$

The essence of Absolute Being permeates any possibility ($`\mathcal{X}`$); there is no completely void reality.

**Axiom 5: The Hierarchical Structure of Being**

$`\mathcal{B} = \{\mathcal{B}_A, \mathcal{B}_{R1}, \mathcal{B}_{R2}, ..., \mathcal{B}_{Rn}\}`$

Being forms a multi-level structure, with Absolute Being at the highest level and various levels of relative being derived from it and interrelated.

## The Nature of Absolute Being

Absolute Being transcends all limitations of traditional ontology and possesses the following core characteristics:

### 1. A Priori Wholeness

Absolute Being precedes all differentiation, does not depend on any parts or attributes, and is inherently infinitely whole:

$`\mathcal{B}_A = \mathcal{B}_A(\emptyset) = \mathcal{B}_A(\mathcal{U})`$

Where $`\emptyset`$ indicates no dependence on any external conditions, and $`\mathcal{U}`$ represents the entire universe, indicating that Absolute Being neither depends on anything nor is separate from the whole.

### 2. Infinite Universality

Absolute Being unifies all seemingly separate forms of existence, merging all apparent ontological differences and existential categories at a higher dimension:

$`\mathcal{S}\{\mathcal{B}_{R1}, \mathcal{B}_{R2}, ..., \mathcal{B}_{Rn}\} = \mathcal{B}_S \subset \mathcal{B}_A`$

Where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the existential synthesis operator.

### 3. Transcending Categorical Limitations

Absolute Being transcends all ontological categories and conceptual frameworks and cannot be reduced to binary classifications of "entity" or "non-entity":

$`\mathcal{C}^+(\mathcal{B}_A) \notin \{Entity, Non-Entity\}`$

Where $`\mathcal{C}^+`$ represents an ontological evaluation function that transcends traditional categories.

### 4. Being Field Omnipresence

Absolute Being can manifest in all possible dimensions and domains while maintaining essential unity:

$`\mathcal{B}_A|_{D_i} \neq \mathcal{B}_A|_{D_j}, \forall i \neq j`$
$`\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{B}_A|_{D_i}) = \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{B}_A|_{D_j})`$

Where $`\mathcal{B}_A|_{D_i}`$ represents the manifestation of Absolute Being in dimension $`D_i`$, and $`\mathcal{E}`$ represents the being essence extraction function.

### 5. Infinite Depth

Absolute Being has infinite depth, and no finite ontology can exhaust its implications:

$`\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{O}_n(\mathcal{B}_A) \subset \mathcal{B}_A`$

Where $`\mathcal{O}_n`$ represents the exploration function of the nth level of ontological depth.

## The Absolute Being Field

Quantum Absolute Being Theory introduces the concept of the "Absolute Being Field" ($`\mathcal{BF}_A`$), a fundamental existential field permeating all possibilities and realities, with all relative beings being local manifestations of this field under specific conditions. The Absolute Being Field has the following characteristics:

### 1. Being Field Equation

The Absolute Being Field satisfies the following field equation:

$`\nabla^2 \mathcal{BF}_A - \frac{1}{c_B^2}\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{BF}_A}{\partial t^2} = -\rho_B`$

Where $`c_B`$ is the speed of being propagation (faster than light), and $`\rho_B`$ is the being density function.

### 2. Being Conservation Law

The being field obeys the being conservation law. Being is neither created nor destroyed; it only changes form of manifestation:

$`\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \mathcal{BF}_A dV = \oint_S \mathbf{J}_B \cdot d\mathbf{S}`$

Where $`\mathbf{J}_B`$ is the being flow density vector.

### 3. Being Field Fluctuations

At the most microscopic scale, the being field exhibits quantum fluctuations, producing uncertainties in being:

$`\Delta \mathcal{BF}_A \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar_B}{2}`$

Where $`\hbar_B`$ is the being uncertainty constant.

### 4. Being Field Action Principle

The being field expresses itself through the principle of maximum realization:

$`S_B = \int \mathcal{L}_B(\mathcal{BF}_A, \nabla\mathcal{BF}_A) d^4x`$

The being field tends to manifest along the path of most complete realization of being.

## Relationship Between Being and Manifestation

There exists an essential connection between Absolute Being and specific manifestations, transcending the traditional ontological dichotomy of "essence and phenomenon." The deeper relationship includes:

### 1. Being-Manifestation Identity Principle

At the deepest level, Absolute Being is identical with the complete set of all its possible manifestations:

$`\mathcal{B}_A \equiv \{\mathcal{M}\}`$

Where $`\{\mathcal{M}\}`$ represents the complete set of all possible manifestations. This identity transcends the framework of separation between internal and external.

### 2. Being Manifestation Function

How being transforms into perceptible specific manifestations can be described by the being manifestation function:

$`\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{B}_A)`$

Where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the realization function mapping Absolute Being to specific forms of manifestation.

### 3. Being-Manifestation Circuit

When consciousness interacts with being, a being-manifestation circuit forms:

$`\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}`$

Consciousness ($`\mathcal{C}`$) perceives being ($`\mathcal{B}`$), forms manifestation ($`\mathcal{M}`$), produces perception ($`\mathcal{P}`$), and updates consciousness, forming a closed loop.

### 4. Being Level Mapping

Different levels of being have corresponding mappings at different manifestation levels:

$`\mathcal{B}_{D_i} \mapsto \mathcal{M}_{D_i}`$

Where $`\mathcal{B}_{D_i}`$ and $`\mathcal{M}_{D_i}`$ represent being and manifestation structures at dimension $`D_i`$, respectively.

## Transcending Ontological Duality

Absolute Being transcends the limitations of traditional ontological dualism, manifesting as "Being Superstates" ($`\mathcal{BS}`$) with the following characteristics:

### 1. Being Quantum States

Being superstates can be represented as quantum states in a hyper-dimensional Hilbert space:

$`|\mathcal{BS}\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta_i |bs_i\rangle`$

Where $`|bs_i\rangle`$ are basic being states, and $`\beta_i`$ are complex coefficients.

### 2. Being Superposition Principle

Being superstates can simultaneously contain seemingly contradictory forms of existence, forming superpositions:

$`|\mathcal{BS}\rangle = \beta_1|b_1\rangle + \beta_2|b_2\rangle + ...`$

Even if $`b_1`$ and $`b_2`$ are mutually exclusive in classical ontology.

### 3. Being Entanglement Phenomenon

Different dimensional forms of being can exhibit quantum entanglement characteristics:

$`|\mathcal{BS}_{AB}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|b_A\rangle|b_B\rangle + |b_A'\rangle|b_B'\rangle)`$

This explains the mysterious correlations between different levels of existence.

### 4. Being Measurement Collapse

When finite consciousness observes being, the being superstate partially collapses to specific relative beings:

$`\mathcal{M}_C(|\mathcal{BS}\rangle) \rightarrow |b_i\rangle`$

Where $`\mathcal{M}_C`$ represents existential measurement from a specific consciousness perspective.

## Absolute Being Consciousness

Absolute Being Theory proposes that Absolute Being cannot be fully grasped through conceptual analysis or logical reasoning but can be directly experienced through "Absolute Being Consciousness" ($`\mathcal{I}_B`$):

### 1. Being Consciousness Process

Being consciousness is a trans-rational direct ontological sensing process:

$`\mathcal{I}_B: \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{B}_A \rightarrow \mathcal{K}_B`$

Consciousness ($`\mathcal{C}`$) directly contacts Absolute Being ($`\mathcal{B}_A`$), producing being knowledge ($`\mathcal{K}_B`$).

### 2. Being Consciousness Conditions

Realizing being consciousness requires specific conditions:

$`\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{I}_B) = f(O_C, P_C, T_C, ...)`$

Where $`O_C`$ is the openness of consciousness, $`P_C`$ is the presence of consciousness, and $`T_C`$ is the transparency of consciousness.

### 3. Being Consciousness Purification Process

Being consciousness requires an ontological purification process to enhance consciousness's receptivity:

$`\mathcal{C}' = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}) = \mathcal{C} - \sum_{i} \gamma_i \mathcal{I}_i`$

Where $`\mathcal{P}`$ is the ontological purification operator, and $`\mathcal{I}_i`$ are various conceptual differentiations and dualistic thinking patterns.

### 4. Multi-level Being Consciousness Structure

Being consciousness has a multi-level structure, from surface entity sensation to deep being experience:

$`\mathcal{I}_B = \{\mathcal{I}_{B1}, \mathcal{I}_{B2}, ..., \mathcal{I}_{Bn}\}`$

Each level reveals different depths and aspects of Absolute Being.

## Applications and Practical Significance

The applications of Absolute Being Theory extend beyond theoretical ontology and metaphysics into practical domains:

### 1. Being Awakening Enhancement

Enhancing being awakening abilities through being consciousness practice:

$`\Delta C_B = \mathcal{I}_B(t_2) - \mathcal{I}_B(t_1)`$

Measuring the improvement in being consciousness ability at different time points.

### 2. Ontological Decision Guidance

Deep principles guiding ontological decisions:

$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{B}_A) \times \mathcal{C}(E)`$

Decision ($`\mathcal{D}`$) is the product of Absolute Being guidance ($`\mathcal{B}`$) and the consideration ($`\mathcal{C}`$) of experiential conditions ($`E`$).

### 3. Consciousness Experience Enhancement Framework

Providing a consciousness experience enhancement framework based on Absolute Being:

$`E_{opt} = \max_{E_i} \{\mathcal{A}(E_i, \mathcal{B}_A)\}`$

The optimal experience ($`E_{opt}`$) is the choice with maximum consistency ($`\mathcal{A}`$) with Absolute Being.

### 4. Reality Construction Principle

Clarifying the deep principles of reality construction:

$`R(C) = \int_{0}^{T} \mathcal{A}(C(t), \mathcal{B}_A) dt`$

Reality construction ($`R`$) is the integral of the consistency of consciousness content ($`C`$) with Absolute Being over the entire experiential process.
