## Blockers

None at present.

## Notes

This paper explores the mathematical relationships between fundamental constants (φ, e, π, α) and their connection to Universe Ontology's collapse breathing proportions through FLIP-XOR-SHIFT operations.

The current implementation of the simulation successfully demonstrates the invariance of the collapse breathing proportion under perturbations, supporting our theoretical framework. Additional validation with higher precision calculations is in progress.
