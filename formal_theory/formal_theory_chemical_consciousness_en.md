## Core Theory Overview

Chemical Consciousness and Perception Theory applies the quantum-classical dualism framework to consciousness and perception phenomena at the molecular level, proposing that molecular systems can exhibit primordial forms of consciousness and perceptual abilities under specific organizational conditions. This theory suggests that molecular consciousness arises from information processing capabilities generated by special structures at the quantum-classical interface, while perception is the classicalization process of molecular systems in their interactions with the environment. By revealing the continuous spectrum from molecules to higher-order perception systems, this theory provides a chemistry-based explanatory framework for the nature and origin of consciousness, while also opening new pathways for understanding the perceptual behaviors of living systems and designing novel intelligent materials.

## Basic Definitions and Axioms

### Formal Definition of Chemical Consciousness Systems

A chemical consciousness system $`\mathcal{C}`$ can be formally defined as:

$$\mathcal{C} = (\mathcal{C}_Q, \mathcal{C}_C, \mathcal{I}_C, \mathcal{P})$$

Where:
- $`\mathcal{C}_Q`$ is the quantum domain component of the consciousness system (quantum information processing, quantum coherent states)
- $`\mathcal{C}_C`$ is the classical domain component of the consciousness system (stable states, memory storage)
- $`\mathcal{I}_C`$ is the quantum-classical consciousness interface
- $`\mathcal{P}`$ is the perception processing structure

### Core Chemical Consciousness Axioms

**Axiom 1: Molecular Consciousness Duality**  
Molecular-level consciousness simultaneously possesses quantum and classical states as two inseparable components:

$$\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C}_Q \diamond \mathcal{C}_C$$

Where $`\diamond`$ represents the quantum-classical consciousness connection operation.

**Axiom 2: Perception as Classicalization**  
Molecular perception is the process of converting quantum possibilities into classical deterministic information:

$$\mathcal{P}: |\Psi_{environment}\rangle \rightarrow \{I_C\}$$

Where $`|\Psi_{environment}\rangle`$ is the quantum state of the environment, and $`\{I_C\}`$ is the set of classicalized information.

**Axiom 3: Consciousness Hierarchy Principle**  
Consciousness exists at multiple levels, from basic molecular components to complex perception networks:

$$\mathcal{C}_{total} = \cup_{i=1}^n \mathcal{C}_i$$

Where $`\mathcal{C}_i`$ represents the i-th level consciousness system.

**Axiom 4: Chemical Memory Principle**  
Molecular memory is the stable fixation of classical information in molecular structures:

$$\mathcal{M}: \{I_C\} \rightarrow S_M$$

Where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the memory operator, and $`S_M`$ is the molecular memory structure.
