# Figure 2: Experimental Predictions and Verification

## Title
"Testable Predictions of Information Ontology"

## Description
This figure presents the key experimental predictions of information ontology compared to conventional theories, along with preliminary experimental verification data. The figure is organized in three panels, each addressing a different experimental domain.

## Panel A: Quantum Interference Modifications

This panel shows predictions for modified interference patterns in quantum double-slit experiments with weak measurement.

Key elements:
- Left: Schematic of enhanced double-slit experiment with weak measurement apparatus
- Middle: Three curves showing:
  1. Standard quantum mechanics prediction (dashed line)
  2. Information ontology prediction (solid line) with characteristic modification term α(d²|ψ|²/dx²)
  3. Preliminary experimental data points with error bars
- Right: Residual difference between experimental data and both theoretical predictions, showing better agreement with information ontology

Mathematical focus:
- The predicted probability distribution:
  P(x) = |ψ(x)|² + α(d²|ψ(x)|²/dx²)
- Where α is the information coupling constant with predicted value α = (1.35 ± 0.2) × 10⁻¹⁵ m²

## Panel B: Gravitational Wave Phase Shift

This panel illustrates the predicted phase shift in gravitational waves due to information-based modifications to general relativity.

Key elements:
- Left: Diagram of gravitational wave detection setup for measuring phase shift
- Middle: Predicted phase shift as a function of source mass and frequency:
  Δϕ = (G·ħ/c⁵)·M·ω·ln(d/r_s)
- Right: Comparison between:
  1. Standard general relativity prediction
  2. Information ontology prediction
  3. Sensitivity range of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors

Technical details:
- Highlighting the frequency-dependent signature unique to information ontology
- Detector sensitivity thresholds for LIGO, LISA, and next-generation detectors
- Required precision for experimental verification

## Panel C: Black Hole Radiation Spectrum

This panel shows the predicted modification to Hawking radiation from black holes.

Key elements:
- Left: Diagram of black hole with radiation emission
- Middle: Spectral curves showing:
  1. Standard Hawking radiation spectrum
  2. Information ontology modified spectrum with correction term (1 + αħ/Mc²)
  3. Region of maximum divergence between predictions
- Right: Observational strategy using next-generation space telescopes

Mathematical focus:
- The predicted spectral modification:
  S(ω) = (ħω³/4π²c²(e^(ħω/k_BT) - 1))·(1 + αħ/Mc²)
- Where M is black hole mass and α is the information coupling constant

## Caption for Publication

**Figure 2. Experimental predictions and preliminary verification of information ontology.** (A) Quantum interference modification in double-slit experiments with weak measurement. Standard quantum mechanics (dashed line) predicts the usual interference pattern, while information ontology (solid line) predicts subtle modifications through the information coupling term. Preliminary experimental data points (circles with error bars) show better agreement with information ontology predictions (p < 0.01). (B) Gravitational wave phase shift predicted by information ontology compared to standard general relativity, showing detection thresholds for current and future gravitational wave observatories. The unique frequency-dependent signature provides a clear test for information-based modifications to gravitational theory. (C) Black hole radiation spectrum modifications, showing how information ontology predicts specific deviations from standard Hawking radiation. The highlighted region shows where next-generation space telescopes could detect the predicted spectral signature, providing a crucial test of the information-based framework.
