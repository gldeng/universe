# Open Access Statement - FUND-FOP-047

## Golden Ratio φ, e, π and Fine Structure Constant α: Collapse Breathing Proportions

### Open Access Intentions

The authors intend to make this research as widely accessible as possible to maximize its impact and contribute to the broader scientific community. We are committed to the principles of open science and the dissemination of knowledge.

### Publication Model Preference

We prefer to publish this article as an **Open Access** publication if funding permits. If institutional funding is not available for the open access fee, we will select the traditional subscription model with self-archiving options.

### Licensing Preference

For open access publication, we prefer the **CC BY 4.0** license (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International), which allows others to:
- Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially

Under the condition that appropriate credit is given to the original work, a link to the license is provided, and any changes made are indicated.

### Self-Archiving Plans

In accordance with Springer Nature's self-archiving policy, if published under the subscription model, we intend to:

1. Deposit the accepted manuscript version (after peer review but before publisher formatting) in:
   - The authors' institutional repositories
   - ArXiv.org preprint server
   - ResearchGate academic network

2. Respect the publisher's embargo period (typically 12 months for Foundations of Physics) before making the accepted manuscript publicly available.

3. Always provide clear citation to the published version and include a link to the publisher's version of record.

### Open Data Commitment

We are committed to making the underlying data, code, and mathematical derivations associated with this research openly available to facilitate reproducibility. Upon publication, we intend to:

1. Publish supplementary mathematical proofs and derivations
2. Share key simulation code through public repositories
3. Provide access to high-precision numerical results

### Funding for Open Access

We are exploring the following options to cover the open access publishing fee (€2,730 / $3,160 as of 2025):

1. Institutional open access funds
2. Research grants (if applicable)
3. Personal resources if necessary

A final decision on the publication model will be made at the time of manuscript acceptance, based on available funding options at that time.
