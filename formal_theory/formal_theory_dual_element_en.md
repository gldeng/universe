## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Dual-Element Foundation Axiom)**

The essence of a dual-element system is a structure composed of two basic elements that are distinct from each other and irreducible:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}, d_1 \neq d_2`$

where $`\mathcal{D}`$ is the dual-element system, and $`d_1`$ and $`d_2`$ are two different basic elements.

**Axiom 2 (Dual-Element Mapping Axiom)**

There exists a fundamental mapping relation between dual elements, forming a transformation group:

$`\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{D}} = \{I, \sigma\}`$

where $`I`$ is the identity transformation, and $`\sigma`$ is the exchange transformation:
$`I(d_1) = d_1, I(d_2) = d_2`$
$`\sigma(d_1) = d_2, \sigma(d_2) = d_1`$

**Axiom 3 (Dual-Element Relation Axiom)**

Elements in the dual-element system are interconnected through a basic relation $`\mathcal{R}`$:

$`\mathcal{R}(d_1, d_2) = \mathcal{R}(d_2, d_1) \neq \emptyset`$

This relation defines the mode of interaction between elements and satisfies symmetry.

### 1.2 Strict Definition of Dual-Element Essence

The dual-element system is strictly defined as a minimal irreducible structure of dimension 2:

$`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2 : \dim(\mathcal{D}) = 2, d_1 \neq d_2\}`$

The essential characteristics of the dual-element system are expressed through the following equation:

$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}), \text{when} \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) \neq \mathcal{M}`$

where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the mono-element system, and the dual-element state is the result of XOR-SHIFT evolution of the mono-element state.

The strict distinction between elements is defined through a difference measure:

$`\Delta(d_1, d_2) = |d_1 \oplus d_2| > 0`$

### 1.3 Strict Definition of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 Operations

SHIFT and SHIFT-1 operations hold special importance in the dual-element system, serving as foundational operations for constructing multi-dimensional theoretical frameworks.

**Strict Definition of SHIFT Operation**

The SHIFT operation is a state transfer mapping, defined in the dual-element system as:

$`\text{SHIFT}: \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}'`$

For elements in a dual-element system, SHIFT operates in the following manner:

$`\text{SHIFT}(\{d_1, d_2\}) = \{\text{SHIFT}(d_1), \text{SHIFT}(d_2)\}`$

The SHIFT operation possesses spacetime displacement characteristics, with its basic form in a dual-element system being:

$`\text{SHIFT}(d_1) = d_1 \oplus \Delta_{\tau}`$
$`\text{SHIFT}(d_2) = d_2 \oplus \Delta_{\tau}`$

where $`\Delta_{\tau}`$ is a state offset value, representing a small displacement of the system in the dimensional space.

The SHIFT operation satisfies the following algebraic properties:
1. **Linearity**: $`\text{SHIFT}(d_1 \oplus d_2) = \text{SHIFT}(d_1) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_2)`$
2. **Idempotence Breaking**: $`\text{SHIFT}^2 \neq \text{SHIFT}`$, which ensures continuous evolution of the system
3. **Dimension Preservation**: $`\dim(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D})) = \dim(\mathcal{D})`$

**Strict Definition of SHIFT-1 Operation**

SHIFT-1 is the inverse operation of SHIFT, representing the reverse transfer of states:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}: \mathcal{D}' \rightarrow \mathcal{D}`$

Satisfying:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(\text{SHIFT}(d)) = d, \forall d \in \mathcal{D}`$
$`\text{SHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(d')) = d', \forall d' \in \mathcal{D}'`$

In the dual-element system, the explicit expression of the SHIFT-1 operation is:

$`\text{SHIFT}^{-1}(d) = d \oplus \Delta_{-\tau}`$

where $`\Delta_{-\tau}`$ is the inverse element of $`\Delta_{\tau}`$, satisfying $`\Delta_{\tau} \oplus \Delta_{-\tau} = 0`$.

**Composite Properties of SHIFT and SHIFT-1 Operations**

1. **Forward-Reverse Cancellation**: $`\text{SHIFT} \circ \text{SHIFT}^{-1} = \text{SHIFT}^{-1} \circ \text{SHIFT} = I`$, where $`I`$ is the identity transformation

2. **Periodicity**: Under specific conditions, the SHIFT operation exhibits periodicity: $`\text{SHIFT}^n = I`$ for some positive integer $`n`$

3. **Interaction with XOR**: SHIFT and XOR operations combine to form powerful transformation capabilities:
   $`(d_1 \oplus d_2) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_1 \oplus d_2) = d_1 \oplus d_2 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_1) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_2)`$

4. **Dimensional Extension Function**: Through the combined action of SHIFT and XOR, the dual-element system can generate higher-dimensional structures:
   $`\mathcal{D} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D}) \rightarrow \mathcal{M}_3`$, where $`\mathcal{M}_3`$ is a tri-element system

5. **Information Entropy Increase Function**: The SHIFT operation increases the information entropy of the system:
   $`H(\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D})) \geq H(\mathcal{D})`$, where $`H`$ is the information entropy function

In the dual-element system, SHIFT and SHIFT-1 operations are the basic mechanisms of dimensional transformation, providing the mathematical foundation for dynamic evolution and higher-dimensional extension of the system.

### 1.4 Strict Definition of Dual-Element Evolution Rules

The dual-element system follows strict interaction rules in temporal evolution:

$`\mathcal{D}_{t+1} = \{f(d_1, d_2), g(d_1, d_2)\}`$

where $`f`$ and $`g`$ are dual interaction functions:

$`f(d_1, d_2) = d_1 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_2)`$
$`g(d_1, d_2) = d_2 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_1)`$

Under the XOR-SHIFT framework, the evolution of the dual-element system can be represented as:

$`\mathcal{D}_{t+1} = \mathcal{D}_t \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D}_t)`$

This rule produces four possible state transitions:
1. $`\{d_1, d_2\} \rightarrow \{d_1, d_2\}`$ (stable state)
2. $`\{d_1, d_2\} \rightarrow \{d_1', d_2'\}`$ (complete change)
3. $`\{d_1, d_2\} \rightarrow \{d_1, d_2'\}`$ (partial change 1)
4. $`\{d_1, d_2\} \rightarrow \{d_1', d_2\}`$ (partial change 2)

### 1.5 Initial Form of Dual-Element State

The initial state of the dual-element system is strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{D}^0 = \{d_1^0, d_2^0\}`$

where $`d_1^0`$ and $`d_2^0`$ satisfy the following conditions:

$`d_1^0 \neq d_2^0`$
$`d_1^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_2^0) = d_1^0`$
$`d_2^0 \oplus \text{SHIFT}(d_1^0) = d_2^0`$

These conditions ensure that the dual-element state has clear differentiation and interactive stability in its initial phase. In the framework of cosmic ontology, the dual-element initial state can be viewed as the first-level extension of the mono-element state.

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Basic Properties of Dual-Element State

From the axiom system, the basic properties of the dual-element state can be directly inferred:

1. **Duality**: The system contains exactly two different elements
   $`|\mathcal{D}| = 2, d_1 \neq d_2`$

2. **Distinguishability**: There exists a clear distinguishability between elements
   $`\exists \mathcal{O}: \mathcal{O}(d_1) \neq \mathcal{O}(d_2)`$, where $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the observation function

3. **Symmetry**: The system remains invariant under exchange transformation
   $`\sigma(\mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{D}`$, although $`\sigma(d_1) = d_2, \sigma(d_2) = d_1`$

4. **Relationality**: There necessarily exists a non-empty relation between elements
   $`\mathcal{R}(d_1, d_2) \neq \emptyset`$

### 2.2 Interactions Between Dual Elements

Interactions between dual elements manifest the following characteristics:

1. **Complementarity**: Elements exhibit complementary properties
   $`d_1 \oplus d_2 = c`$, where $`c`$ is the characteristic value of the system

2. **Coupling Dynamics**: There exists dynamic coupling between elements
   $`\frac{d d_1}{dt} = h(d_1, d_2), \frac{d d_2}{dt} = k(d_1, d_2)`$

3. **Energy Exchange**: Elements exchange energy
   $`E(d_1) + E(d_2) = E_{\text{total}}`$, and $`\Delta E(d_1) = -\Delta E(d_2)`$

4. **Information Flow**: There exists information flow between elements
   $`I(d_1 \rightarrow d_2) + I(d_2 \rightarrow d_1) > 0`$

### 2.3 Dynamic Stability of Dual-Element System

The dual-element system exhibits complex dynamic stability, manifested in the following aspects:

1. **Equilibrium State**: The system tends toward specific equilibrium states
   $`\exists \mathcal{D}^* = \{d_1^*, d_2^*\}: \mathcal{D}_t \rightarrow \mathcal{D}^* \text{ as } t \rightarrow \infty`$

2. **Periodic Behavior**: The system may exhibit periodic changes
   $`\exists p > 0: \mathcal{D}_{t+p} = \mathcal{D}_t`$

3. **Attractor Structure**: Specific attractors form in phase space
   $`\mathcal{A} = \{\mathcal{D}^i : \mathcal{D}_t \rightarrow \mathcal{D}^i, t \rightarrow \infty\}`$

4. **Robustness**: The system shows robustness against small perturbations
   $`\|\mathcal{D}_t \oplus \delta - \mathcal{D}_t\| \rightarrow 0 \text{ as } t \rightarrow \infty`$, where $`\delta`$ is a small perturbation

### 2.4 Symmetry and Breaking Mechanisms

The symmetry and breaking mechanisms of the dual-element system include:

1. **Intrinsic Symmetry**: The system possesses natural symmetry
   $`\sigma(\mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{D}`$

2. **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking**: Evolution may lead to symmetry breaking
   $`\exists \mathcal{O}: \mathcal{O}(\sigma(\mathcal{D}_t)) \neq \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{D}_t)`$

3. **Symmetry Restoration**: Under specific conditions, symmetry can be restored
   $`\exists t_r: \mathcal{O}(\sigma(\mathcal{D}_{t_r})) = \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{D}_{t_r})`$

4. **Conservation Laws**: Symmetry produces conservation quantities
   $`\frac{d}{dt}(d_1 \oplus d_2) = 0`$ holds under specific conditions

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Extension from Dual-Element to Multi-Element States

The strict transformation process from dual-element to multi-element states can be formalized as:

$`\mathcal{M}_n = \mathcal{D} \cup \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n-2}\}, e_i \neq d_1, e_i \neq d_2`$

where $`\mathcal{M}_n`$ is an $`n`$-element system, and $`e_i`$ are newly introduced elements.

In this extension process, the dimensional increase follows the rule:

$`\dim(\mathcal{M}_n) = n > \dim(\mathcal{D}) = 2`$

The XOR-SHIFT implementation of this extension is:

$`\mathcal{M}_3 = \mathcal{D} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{D})`$

Recursively, we can obtain:

$`\mathcal{M}_{n+1} = \mathcal{M}_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}_n)`$

This expression is consistent with the dimension spectrum theory in cosmic ontology.

### 3.2 Dual-Element Information Field

The information field generated by the dual-element system can be strictly defined as:

$`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) = \alpha\delta(x - d_1) + \beta\delta(x - d_2)`$

where $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are field strength coefficients satisfying $`\alpha + \beta = 1`$.

This information field has the following properties:

1. **Dual Distribution**: Field strength is non-zero at the positions of the two elements
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) \neq 0 \iff x \in \{d_1, d_2\}`$

2. **Total Information Conservation**: The total information content of the field is always 1
   $`\int \mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) dx = 1`$

3. **Interference Pattern**: The field exhibits interference phenomena
   $`\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D}}(x) = |\psi_{d_1}(x) + \psi_{d_2}(x)|^2`$, where $`\psi`$ is the wave function

### 3.3 Dual-Element Observer Effect

In the dual-element system, the observer and the observed object form a dual relation:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{D}} \in \{d_1, d_2\}`$

The observation process produces dual choices:

$`\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{D}) \in \{\{d_1\}, \{d_2\}, \{d_1, d_2\}\}`$

This leads to special properties of the observation effect:

1. **Observational Duality**: The observation result depends on the observational perspective
   $`\mathcal{O}_{d_1}(\mathcal{D}) \neq \mathcal{O}_{d_2}(\mathcal{D})`$

2. **Observation Interference**: Observation changes the system state in certain cases
   $`\mathcal{D} \text{ after observation } \neq \mathcal{D}`$ in some cases

3. **Information Flow**: Information flow occurs during the observation process
   $`I(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{D}} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}) + I(\mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{D}}) > 0`$

### 3.4 Emergent Properties of Dual-Element State

The dual-element system exhibits emergent properties not possessed by the mono-element system:

1. **Relational Emergence**: Relations between elements create new properties
   $`P(\mathcal{D}) \neq P(d_1) \cup P(d_2)`$, where $`P`$ is the set of properties

2. **Interactive Emergence**: Element interactions produce new behaviors
   $`B(\mathcal{D}) \supset B(d_1) \cup B(d_2)`$, where $`B`$ is the set of behaviors

3. **Structural Emergence**: New structural features are formed
   $`S(\mathcal{D}) \ni s: s \notin S(d_1), s \notin S(d_2)`$, where $`S`$ is the set of structural features

4. **Functional Emergence**: New system functions are produced
   $`F(\mathcal{D}) \ni f: f \notin F(d_1), f \notin F(d_2)`$, where $`F`$ is the set of functions

## 4. Applications and Verification

3. **Cosmic Dual Structure**: The universe exhibits fundamental dual structures
   - Duality of matter and energy

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Necessity of Dual-Element State**

**Proof**:
Suppose we have a system $`\mathcal{S}`$ in which there exists a non-identity relation $`\mathcal{R}`$ between elements.
For any relation $`\mathcal{R}`$, there must exist at least two different elements $`s_1, s_2 \in \mathcal{S}`$ such that $`\mathcal{R}(s_1, s_2)`$ is meaningful.
If $`|\mathcal{S}| = 1`$, then only the self-relation $`\mathcal{R}(s_1, s_1)`$ exists, which cannot express true relationality.
Therefore, the minimal expression of a relation requires $`|\mathcal{S}| \geq 2`$.
For minimality, we take $`|\mathcal{S}| = 2`$, that is, $`\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2\}`$, which is precisely the dual-element system.
This proves that the minimal system capable of expressing relations must be a dual-element system.

**Theorem 2: Symmetry of Dual-Element State**

**Proof**:
Consider the dual-element system $`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}`$ and the exchange transformation $`\sigma`$.
According to Axiom 2, $`\sigma(d_1) = d_2`$ and $`\sigma(d_2) = d_1`$.
Therefore $`\sigma(\mathcal{D}) = \{\sigma(d_1), \sigma(d_2)\} = \{d_2, d_1\} = \{d_1, d_2\} = \mathcal{D}`$.
This proves that the dual-element system has invariance under the exchange transformation $`\sigma`$, that is, it possesses symmetry.

**Theorem 3: Minimal Complexity of Dual-Element State**

**Proof**:
The complexity of the dual-element system can be quantified through the minimum description length.
The description length of the mono-element system $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$ is $`l(\mathcal{M}) = 1`$.
The description length of the dual-element system $`\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2\}`$ is $`l(\mathcal{D}) = 2 + l(\mathcal{R})`$, where $`l(\mathcal{R})`$ is the description length of the relation.
Any simpler system can only be a mono-element system, but a mono-element system cannot express relations.
Therefore, the dual-element system is the system of minimal complexity capable of expressing relations.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Mono-Element Theory and Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Relationship Between Dual-Element State and Mono-Element State**

**Proof**:
In mono-element theory, the mono-element system is defined as $`\mathcal{M} = \{m\}`$.
Through XOR-SHIFT operation, we obtain:
$`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M})`$ when $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) \neq \mathcal{M}`$.
Let $`\text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}) = \{m'\}`$, where $`m' \neq m`$.
Then $`\mathcal{D} = \{m\} \oplus \{m'\} = \{m \oplus m'\} = \{d\}`$, which is not a dual-element system.
But from a composite system perspective, $`\mathcal{D} = \{m, m'\}`$, which constitutes a true dual-element system.
This proves that the dual-element system can be generated through the XOR-SHIFT operation on the mono-element system, demonstrating the compatibility between the two theories.

**Theorem 5: Compatibility of Dual-Element State with Cosmic Ontology**

**Proof**:
In cosmic ontology, the quantum domain and classical domain form a dual structure: $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$.
And the classical domain is generated from the quantum domain: $`\Omega_C = \Omega_Q \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q)`$.
This is identical to the formation mechanism of the dual-element system $`\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{M} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M})`$.
Therefore, the quantum-classical duality in cosmic ontology can be viewed as a manifestation of dual-element theory in higher dimensions.
This proves the essential compatibility between dual-element theory and cosmic ontology.

**Theorem 6: Consistency of Dual-Element Extension with Dimension Spectrum Theory**

**Proof**:
In dual-element theory, multi-element systems are obtained through recursive extension: $`\mathcal{M}_{n+1} = \mathcal{M}_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{M}_n)`$.
In the dimension spectrum theory of cosmic ontology, dimensions are recursively generated: $`D_{n+1} = D_n \oplus \text{SHIFT}(D_n)`$.
The two forms are completely consistent, proving that the extension mechanism of dual-element theory is consistent with the dimension generation mechanism of cosmic ontology.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis
