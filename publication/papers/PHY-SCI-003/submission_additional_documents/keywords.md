# Keywords

The following keywords have been selected to represent the core concepts, methods, and implications of the manuscript "Information Ontology: Rewriting the Foundations of Physics":

1. **Information Ontology**
   - Primary concept introducing information as the fundamental substrate of reality
   - Bridges physics and information theory in a novel paradigm

2. **Quantum Foundations**
   - Addresses fundamental interpretational issues in quantum mechanics
   - Connects to quantum measurement problem and non-locality

3. **Theoretical Physics**
   - Encompasses the broader field of fundamental physical theories
   - Allows indexing within mainstream physics literature

4. **XOR-SHIFT Operations**
   - Highlights the novel mathematical formalism introduced
   - Represents the specific mechanics of information manipulation in the theory

5. **Unified Field Theory**
   - Positions the work within the context of unification attempts in physics
   - Connects to the goal of reconciling quantum mechanics and relativity

## Selection Rationale

These keywords have been strategically selected to:
- Maximize discoverability across multiple disciplines (physics, information theory, philosophy of science)
- Balance specificity (XOR-SHIFT Operations) with generality (Theoretical Physics)
- Emphasize both methodological innovations and theoretical implications
- Facilitate appropriate categorization within Science journal's taxonomy
- Appeal to researchers across quantum foundations, information theory, and unification efforts

## Alternative Keywords Considered

The following additional keywords were considered but not included in the final selection:
- Quantum Gravity (too specific to one application of the theory)
- Information Theory (too broad without the ontological context)
- Black Hole Thermodynamics (represents only one application area)
- Physical Reality (too philosophical for primary indexing)
- Quantum Information (could be mistaken for quantum computing applications)
