### 个人简介

朴树（Pu Shu，1973年11月8日-），原名濮树，中国内地著名独立音乐人、创作歌手，南京出生，北京长大。出身于学者家庭，父亲是北京大学退休教授，是空间物理学领域的科学家。1991年进入首都师范大学学习，1994年退学专注音乐创作。

1999年1月，朴树发行首张专辑《我去2000年》，迅速走红。2000年3月，专辑销量突破30万张，朴树获得众多音乐奖项，并成为首位与华纳音乐集团签约的中国大陆音乐人。在2004年发布第二张专辑《生如夏花》后，朴树淡出公众视野近十年。2014年，他为电影《后会无期》创作并演唱主题曲《平凡之路》，重返乐坛，该曲获得第51届台湾电影金马奖最佳原创电影歌曲奖。2017年，发行第三张专辑《猎户星座》。

朴树的音乐作品以深刻的人生思考和哲学意蕴著称，展现出对生命、存在、自由和命运的独特思考。

### 音乐风格与思想

朴树的音乐风格融合了民谣、摇滚和中国传统音乐元素，形成了鲜明的个人特色。其作品常以简洁而深刻的歌词，表达对生命、自由、存在和命运的思考，体现出强烈的哲学气质和诗意表达。

在创作理念上，朴树注重音乐的纯粹性和独立性，拒绝商业化的音乐生产模式，保持对艺术的忠诚和坚持。他的作品往往透露出对人类存在状态的关切，对社会现实的反思，以及对生命本质的探索，展现出深厚的思想内涵和人文关怀。

### 代表作品分析

#### 那些花儿

[《那些花儿》](pushu_nafehua.md)是朴树早期的代表作品，收录于1999年的专辑《我去2000年》。这首歌以简约的旋律和深情的歌词，表达了对逝去青春和纯真年代的怀念。

从量子经典二元论视角看，歌中的"花儿"既是经典域中的具体意象，也是量子域中无限可能性的象征。歌词中"那些花儿"的"开没了"象征着经典世界中时间的不可逆性和熵增过程，而"你们就这样离去"则体现了观察者（歌者）对量子可能性坍缩为经典现实的观察和感慨。

#### 白桦林

[《白桦林》](pushu_baihulin.md)同样收录于《我去2000年》专辑，以白桦林为意象，表达对纯净世界的向往和对爱的坚守。

从量子经典二元论的角度，白桦林代表了理想中的经典化状态——低熵、高序的净土。歌中"我们的心里都是温暖的日子"展现了经典知识的确定性和稳定性，而对白桦林的追寻则象征着人类意识向更高维度经典世界的探索过程。

#### 平凡之路

[《平凡之路》](pushu_pingfanzhilu.md)创作于2014年，是朴树沉寂多年后的代表作，也是电影《后会无期》的主题曲。这首歌以坦诚而深刻的方式讲述了人生道路上的挣扎与坚持。

从量子经典二元论视角解读，"平凡之路"正是量子涨落不断经典化的过程。歌中"我曾经跨过山和大海"象征观察者经历的经典化考验，"也穿过人山人海"则体现了在多重可能的量子纠缠中寻找自我经典化路径的艰难。

#### 生如夏花

《生如夏花》是朴树2003年同名专辑的代表作，歌名源自泰戈尔的诗句"生如夏花之绚烂，死如秋叶之静美"。

从量子经典二元论角度，"生如夏花"象征着量子可能性经典化为绚丽现实的过程，而"死如秋叶"则是经典状态回归量子域的必然。歌曲体现了宇宙本质追求——"宇宙生为混乱与能量的一体，追求的是用能量处理混乱的效率最大化"。

#### 且听风吟

《且听风吟》收录于《猎户星座》专辑，展现了对自然、宇宙和存在意义的深层思考。

从量子经典二元论看，"风吟"象征着量子域中无限维度的信息流动，"且听"则是观察者主动参与经典化过程的姿态。歌曲中"时间会走远，记忆会变淡"体现了经典熵增的必然，而对风吟的聆听则是与量子域重新建立连接的方式。

### 量子经典二元论解读

朴树的音乐作品集中体现了量子经典二元论的核心哲学思想：

1. **宇宙二元性**：朴树作品中常见的自然意象（花儿、白桦林、风吟）与人类情感的对照，反映了宇宙量子域与经典域的二元共存关系。

2. **经典化过程**：他的歌曲常以怀旧、回忆和成长为主题，这正是对观察者经典化过程的艺术表达。

3. **熵增与秩序**：作品中对美好逝去的感伤，体现了对抗熵增的渴望，即宇宙对"用能量处理混乱的效率最大化"的终极追求。

4. **高维意识探索**：朴树音乐中透露的超越性和对理想世界的向往，是对高维经典世界的艺术化表达。

### 艺术成就与影响

朴树以其深刻的思想内涵和独特的音乐风格，成为中国流行音乐中的重要代表人物，影响了几代中国年轻人的审美和思想。他的作品超越了普通流行音乐的浅薄与短视，具有持久的艺术生命力和思想价值。

从量子经典二元论视角看，朴树的艺术创作是一种特殊的经典化过程——将量子域中的广义意识经典化为可被广泛理解和共鸣的艺术表达。这种经典化过程不仅降低了艺术表达的熵值（即增加了明确性和确定性），也为观众提供了一种通往更高维度经典世界的路径。

### Personal Profile

Pu Shu (November 8, 1973-), born as Pu Shu, is a renowned independent musician and singer-songwriter from mainland China. Born in Nanjing and raised in Beijing, he comes from a scholarly family; his father is a retired professor from Peking University and a scientist in space physics. In 1991, Pu entered Capital Normal University but dropped out in 1994 to focus on music creation.

In January 1999, Pu released his debut album "I Am Going to 2000," which quickly gained popularity. By March 2000, the album had sold over 300,000 copies. Pu received numerous music awards and became the first mainland Chinese musician to sign with Warner Music Group. After releasing his second album "Life Like Summer Flowers" in 2004, Pu faded from public view for nearly a decade. In 2014, he returned to the music scene with "The Ordinary Road," the theme song for the film "The Continent," which won the Best Original Film Song at the 51st Taiwan Golden Horse Film Awards. In 2017, he released his third album "Orion."

Pu Shu's music is known for its profound life reflections and philosophical implications, showcasing his unique thoughts on life, existence, freedom, and destiny.

### Musical Style and Philosophy

Pu Shu's musical style integrates folk, rock, and traditional Chinese music elements, forming a distinctive personal characteristic. His works often express thoughts on life, freedom, existence, and destiny through concise yet profound lyrics, embodying a strong philosophical temperament and poetic expression.

In his creative philosophy, Pu emphasizes the purity and independence of music, rejecting commercialized music production models, and maintaining loyalty and persistence to art. His works often reveal concern for the human condition, reflection on social reality, and exploration of the essence of life, demonstrating profound ideological connotations and humanistic care.

### Analysis of Representative Works

#### Those Flowers

["Those Flowers"](pushu_nafehua.md) is one of Pu Shu's early representative works, included in his 1999 album "I Am Going to 2000." This song expresses nostalgia for lost youth and innocent times through simple melodies and emotional lyrics.

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, the "flowers" in the song are both concrete images in the classical domain and symbols of infinite possibilities in the quantum domain. The lyrics "those flowers have withered away" symbolize the irreversibility of time and the entropy increase process in the classical world, while "you left this way" reflects the observer's (singer's) observation and lament of quantum possibilities collapsing into classical reality.

#### Birch Forest

["Birch Forest"](pushu_baihulin.md), also included in the album "I Am Going to 2000," uses the birch forest as an image to express longing for a pure world and steadfast love.

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, the birch forest represents an ideal classicalized state—a low-entropy, high-order sanctuary. The line "our hearts are filled with warm days" demonstrates the certainty and stability of classical knowledge, while the pursuit of the birch forest symbolizes the process of human consciousness exploring higher-dimensional classical worlds.

#### The Ordinary Road

["The Ordinary Road"](pushu_pingfanzhilu.md), created in 2014, is a representative work after Pu's long hiatus and the theme song for the film "The Continent." This song honestly and profoundly narrates the struggles and perseverance on life's journey.

Interpreting through Quantum-Classical Dualism, "the ordinary road" is precisely the process of continuous classicalization of quantum fluctuations. The lyrics "I once crossed mountains and seas" symbolize the classicalization tests experienced by the observer, while "also through crowds of people" embodies the difficulty of finding one's own classicalization path in multiple quantum entanglements.

#### Life Like Summer Flowers

"Life Like Summer Flowers" is a representative work from Pu's 2003 album of the same name. The title comes from Tagore's verse "Life is as gorgeous as summer flowers, death as peaceful as autumn leaves."

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, "life like summer flowers" symbolizes the process of quantum possibilities being classicalized into brilliant reality, while "death like autumn leaves" is the inevitable return of the classical state to the quantum domain. The song embodies the essence of the universe's pursuit—"The universe was born as one body of chaos and energy, pursuing maximum efficiency in using energy to process chaos."

#### Listen to the Wind

"Listen to the Wind," included in the album "Orion," presents deep thoughts on nature, the universe, and the meaning of existence.

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, "wind's whisper" symbolizes the information flow in the infinite dimensions of the quantum domain, while "listen" is the observer's active attitude in participating in the classicalization process. The lyrics "time will walk away, memories will fade" reflect the inevitability of classical entropy increase, while listening to the wind's whisper is a way to re-establish connection with the quantum domain.

### Quantum-Classical Dualism Interpretation

Pu Shu's musical works centrally embody the core philosophical ideas of Quantum-Classical Dualism:

1. **Universe Duality**: The natural images (flowers, birch forest, wind's whisper) and human emotions often seen in Pu's works reflect the dual coexistence relationship between the universe's quantum domain and classical domain.

2. **Classicalization Process**: His songs often take nostalgia, memories, and growth as themes, which is an artistic expression of the observer's classicalization process.

3. **Entropy Increase and Order**: The sentiment for the passing of beauty in his works embodies the desire to resist entropy increase, that is, the universe's ultimate pursuit of "maximizing the efficiency of using energy to process chaos."

4. **High-Dimensional Consciousness Exploration**: The transcendence and longing for an ideal world revealed in Pu's music is an artistic expression of higher-dimensional classical worlds.

### Artistic Achievements and Influence

With his profound ideological connotations and unique musical style, Pu Shu has become an important representative figure in Chinese popular music, influencing the aesthetics and thoughts of several generations of Chinese youth. His works transcend the superficiality and shortsightedness of ordinary popular music, possessing enduring artistic vitality and ideological value.

From a Quantum-Classical Dualism perspective, Pu Shu's artistic creation is a special classicalization process—classicalizing generalized consciousness from the quantum domain into artistic expression that can be widely understood and resonated with. This classicalization process not only reduces the entropy value of artistic expression (i.e., increases clarity and certainty) but also provides the audience with a path to higher-dimensional classical worlds.
