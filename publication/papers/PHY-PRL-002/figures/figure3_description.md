## Key Insights

This experiment tests the Universe Ontology prediction that quantum systems with XOR-SHIFT coupling exhibit phase transitions with a distinctive critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.615$. This specific value emerges from the algebraic properties of XOR-SHIFT operations and differs significantly from known universality classes.

The scaling relation:
$$E(\lambda) \propto |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{\nu} \approx |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{1.615}$$

Near the critical point, the system energy scales with this characteristic exponent, providing a clear experimental signature that can be used to validate or falsify the Universe Ontology theory.

The experimental approach leverages recent advances in trapped ion quantum simulation, where coupling strengths can be precisely controlled and tuned. By systematically measuring the system energy as a function of coupling strength $\lambda$, the experiment can determine the critical exponent with sufficient precision to differentiate between the Universe Ontology prediction and other theoretical models.

The existence of this specific critical exponent would provide strong evidence for the fundamental role of XOR-SHIFT operations in quantum dynamics, as proposed by the Universe Ontology theory.
