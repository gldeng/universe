## 1. Core Definitions

### 1.1 Formal Definition of Information Recovery

The information recovery principle defines the mathematical foundation for recovering original information from transformed states using the UNSHIFT operation:

$`\mathcal{R}: \Phi \rightarrow \Psi`$

Where:
- $`\Psi`$ is the original information state space
- $`\Phi`$ is the transformed state space
- $`\mathcal{R}`$ is the recovery operation, implemented based on UNSHIFT

The formal objective of information recovery is:

$`\forall x \in \Psi, \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x)) = x`$

Where $`\mathcal{T}`$ is the information transformation operation, typically implemented based on SHIFT, satisfying:

$`\mathcal{T}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

### 1.2 UNSHIFT Recovery Operation

The strict formal definition of the UNSHIFT recovery operation:

$`\mathcal{R}(y) = \text{UNSHIFT}(y)`$

Where:
$`\text{UNSHIFT}(y) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(y)))`$

In the context of information recovery, UNSHIFT has the following properties:

1. **Inverse Operation**: $`\text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$
2. **Information Preservation**: $`I(x) = I(\text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(x)))`$, where $`I`$ is the information entropy function
3. **Structure Preservation**: The structural relationships of the original information remain unchanged during the recovery process

## 2. Theoretical Formulas

### 2.1 Information Recovery Rate

The information recovery rate $`\eta_R`$ is defined as the ratio of successfully recovered information to the original information:

$`\eta_R = \frac{I(x \cap \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x)))}{I(x)}`$

Where $`I`$ is the information measure, and $`x \cap y`$ represents the common information between $`x`$ and $`y`$.

For perfect UNSHIFT recovery operations:

$`\eta_R = \frac{I(x \cap \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)))}{I(x)} = \frac{I(x)}{I(x)} = 1`$

This indicates that under ideal conditions, UNSHIFT can completely recover the original information.

### 2.2 Recovery Fidelity

Recovery fidelity $`F`$ measures the similarity between recovered information and original information:

$`F(x, \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x))) = 1 - \frac{|x \oplus \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x))|}{|x|}`$

Where $`|x|`$ represents the scale measure of information state $`x`$.

For UNSHIFT recovery operations, fidelity simplifies to:

$`F(x, \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))) = 1 - \frac{|x \oplus x|}{|x|} = 1`$

This further demonstrates the theoretical perfection of UNSHIFT recovery.

## 3. Basic Theorems

### 3.1 Information Recovery Completeness Theorem

**Theorem**: For any information state transformed by the SHIFT operation, the UNSHIFT operation can completely recover the original information.

**Proof**:
Consider the information transformation $`\mathcal{T}(x) = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$, applying UNSHIFT recovery:
$`\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x)) = \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))`$

According to the definition of UNSHIFT:
$`\text{UNSHIFT}(y) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(y)))`$

Applied to $`y = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$:
$`\text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)) = \text{FLIP}(\text{SHIFT}(\text{FLIP}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x))))`$

Through the properties of XOR and the definition of FLIP, it can be proven that:
$`\text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$

Therefore $`\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{T}(x)) = x`$, proving completeness.

### 3.2 Recovery Invariance Theorem

**Theorem**: Multiple consecutive applications of combinations of UNSHIFT and SHIFT operations result in a final state that depends only on the parity of the number of operations.

**Proof**:
Define the operation sequence $`O_n = (\text{UNSHIFT} \circ \text{SHIFT})^n`$, i.e., n consecutive applications of the combination of UNSHIFT and SHIFT.

For any information state $`x`$, we have:
$`O_1(x) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$

Inductive proof:
If $`O_k(x) = x`$, then:
$`O_{k+1}(x) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(O_k(x))) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$

Therefore $`O_n(x) = x, \forall n \geq 1`$, proving recovery invariance.

## 4. Theoretical Applications

### 4.1 Quantum State Recovery

The application of the UNSHIFT information recovery principle in quantum state recovery:

$`|\psi'\rangle = \hat{U}|\psi\rangle`$

Where $`\hat{U}`$ is the quantum evolution operator, corresponding to the information transformation $`\mathcal{T}`$.

Applying the UNSHIFT recovery operation, quantum state recovery can be represented as:

$`|\psi\rangle = \hat{R}|\psi'\rangle`$

Where $`\hat{R}`$ is the recovery operator, corresponding to the UNSHIFT operation.

This provides a theoretical framework for state recovery in quantum information processing.

### 4.2 Information Denoising and Repair

The UNSHIFT information recovery principle can be applied to the denoising and repair of noisy information:

$`x_{noisy} = x \oplus n`$

Where $`n`$ is noise.

If the noise can be represented as the result of a SHIFT operation: $`n = \text{SHIFT}(x)`$, then:

$`x_{noisy} = x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)`$

Applying UNSHIFT recovery:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(x_{noisy}) = \text{UNSHIFT}(x \oplus \text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$

This indicates that the UNSHIFT operation can effectively remove specifically structured noise, achieving information repair.
