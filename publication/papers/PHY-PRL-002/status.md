## Notes

The manuscript presents five key predictions that are experimentally testable with current or near-term technology. The mathematical derivations have been verified for consistency with the Universe Ontology framework. The paper is structured to emphasize the falsifiable nature of the predictions and their divergence from standard quantum theory.
