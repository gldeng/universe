## Required Actions

1. Create detailed figures for each experimental prediction
2. Complete mathematical derivations in appendix
3. Expand references with recent experimental papers
4. Prepare cover letter for submission
5. Format manuscript according to PRL guidelines

## Technical Requirements Check

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Word count | ‚úÖ | Within PRL limits (< 3700 words) |
| Figure count | üîÑ | Plan for 4 figures in main text (one per prediction) |
| Abstract length | ‚úÖ | Within limits |
| Reference format | ‚è≥ | Needs to be converted to PRL style |
| Equation numbering | ‚è≥ | To be finalized |

## Reviewer Considerations

Potential critiques to address:
1. Experimental feasibility with current technology
2. Clarification on how XOR operations physically manifest
3. Distinction from other quantum information approaches
4. Quantitative comparison with standard quantum mechanics predictions
5. Statistical significance requirements

## Notes

- Need to coordinate with experimental collaborators for feasibility assessment
- Consider adding simulation results for predicted effects
- May need to streamline for PRL's strict length requirements
