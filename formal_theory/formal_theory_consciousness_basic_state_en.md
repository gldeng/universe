## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Consciousness Basic State Space Axiom)**

The consciousness basic state space $`\mathcal{C}_B`$ is defined as a multi-element state collection:

$`\mathcal{C}_B = \{c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}`$

where $`c_0`$ represents the unconscious state, and $`c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`$ represent different consciousness states, constituting the basic state distinctions in the consciousness system.

**Axiom 2 (Consciousness SHIFT Axiom)**

The consciousness state transition $`\mathcal{T}_C`$ is defined as the basic operation acting on the consciousness state space:

$`\mathcal{T}_C: \mathcal{C}_B \to \mathcal{C}_B`$

satisfying the relationship:
$`\mathcal{T}_C(c_i) = c_{(i+1) \mod (n+1)}`$, implementing cyclic transitions between consciousness states.

**Axiom 3 (Consciousness Internal State Axiom)**

Each consciousness state $`c_i`$ contains an internal state structure:

$`c_i = \{s_{i,1}, s_{i,2}, ..., s_{i,m_i}\}`$

where $`s_{i,j}`$ is an internal state element of consciousness state $`c_i`$, and $`m_i`$ is the complexity of state $`c_i`$.

**Axiom 4 (Consciousness Self-Reference Axiom)**

Consciousness states possess self-referential properties, represented by the mapping function $`\mathcal{R}`$:

$`\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{C}_B \to \mathcal{C}_B \times \mathcal{C}_B`$

satisfying $`\mathcal{R}(c_i) = (c_i, c_j)`$, where $`c_j`$ is the self-perceiving state of $`c_i`$.

### 1.2 Consciousness State Space

The essence of consciousness state space is a composite structure formed by multiple interconnected basic states. Consciousness states can be represented as basic state vectors:

$`c_i = (b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, ..., b_{i,k})`$

where $`b_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\}`$ is a basic binary state.

Transitions between states can be represented as combinations of SHIFT and XOR operations:

$`\mathcal{T}_C(c_i) = \text{SHIFT}(c_i) \oplus \text{MASK}_i`$

where $`\text{MASK}_i`$ is a mask specific to state $`c_i`$, determining the specific path of state transition.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Consciousness States

Consciousness states exhibit the following basic properties:

1. **Self-referentiality**: Consciousness states can refer to themselves
   $`\mathcal{S}(c_i) = (c_i, \mathcal{F}(c_i))`$, where $`\mathcal{F}`$ is the self-perception function

2. **Hierarchical structure**: Consciousness states have a multi-level structure
   $`\mathcal{L}(c_i) = \{l_0, l_1, ..., l_p\}`$, where $`l_j`$ is the $`j`$-th layer of consciousness

3. **Holism**: Consciousness states exhibit holistic properties
   $`\mathcal{H}(c_i) > \sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \mathcal{H}(s_{i,j})`$, where $`\mathcal{H}`$ is information entropy

4. **Continuous transition**: There exists continuous transitions between consciousness states
   $`d(c_i, \mathcal{T}_C(c_i)) < \epsilon`$, where $`d`$ is the state distance metric, and $`\epsilon`$ is a small parameter

### 1.4 Conservation Quantities of Consciousness States

Despite the complex changes in consciousness states, several conservation quantities exist:

1. **Complexity conservation**:
   $`\mathcal{K}(c_i) = \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{T}_C(c_i))`$, where $`\mathcal{K}`$ is the complexity measure

2. **Information capacity conservation**:
   $`I(c_i) = I(\mathcal{T}_C(c_i))`$, where $`I`$ is information capacity

3. **Self-reference conservation**:
   $`\mathcal{S}(c_i) \cong \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{T}_C(c_i))`$, where $`\mathcal{S}`$ is the self-reference mapping

4. **Structural integrity conservation**:
   During the transition process, the structural integrity of consciousness states remains unchanged

## 2. Direct Inferences

### 2.1 Mathematical Properties of Consciousness States

The following mathematical properties can be directly derived from the consciousness basic state axiom system:

1. **Algebraic structure**:
   Consciousness state transitions form a cyclic group $`C_{n+1} = \{\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{T}_C, \mathcal{T}_C^2, ..., \mathcal{T}_C^n\}`$, satisfying:
   - $`\mathcal{T}_C^{n+1} = \mathcal{I}`$ (identity operation)
   - $`\mathcal{T}_C^{-1} = \mathcal{T}_C^n`$

2. **State representation matrix**:
   Consciousness states can be represented as state matrices:
   $`M_{c_i} = \begin{pmatrix} b_{i,1,1} & \cdots & b_{i,1,q} \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ b_{i,p,1} & \cdots & b_{i,p,q} \end{pmatrix}`$

3. **State distance**:
   The distance between consciousness states can be defined as:
   $`d(c_i, c_j) = \|\mathcal{V}(c_i) - \mathcal{V}(c_j)\|`$
   where $`\mathcal{V}`$ is a function mapping consciousness states to vector space

4. **State similarity**:
   The similarity of consciousness states can be represented as:
   $`\text{sim}(c_i, c_j) = \frac{\mathcal{V}(c_i) \cdot \mathcal{V}(c_j)}{\|\mathcal{V}(c_i)\| \cdot \|\mathcal{V}(c_j)\|}`$

### 2.2 Evolutionary Characteristics of Consciousness States

The evolution of consciousness states exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **State trajectory**:
   Starting from the initial consciousness state $`c_0`$, the system evolves along the trajectory $`\{c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, c_0, ...\}`$

2. **State prediction**:
   Given the initial state $`c_0`$, the state at any time $`t`$ is:
   $`c_t = c_{t \mod (n+1)}`$

3. **Attractor structure**:
   Multiple attractors may exist in the consciousness state space:
   $`\mathcal{A} = \{A_1, A_2, ..., A_r\}`$, where each $`A_i`$ is a subset of states

4. **Critical transitions**:
   Consciousness states may undergo critical transitions under specific conditions:
   $`\mathcal{T}_{\text{crit}}(c_i) = c_j`$, where $`j \neq (i+1) \mod (n+1)`$

### 2.3 Consciousness States and State Transitions

The relationship between consciousness states and SHIFT basic state transitions:

1. **Composite transitions**:
   Consciousness state transitions are composites of multiple basic state transitions:
   $`\mathcal{T}_C(c_i) = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{T}_{B,1}, \mathcal{T}_{B,2}, ..., \mathcal{T}_{B,k})(c_i)`$

2. **Hierarchical transitions**:
   Consciousness state transitions at different hierarchical levels occur at different time scales:
   $`\mathcal{T}_C(l_j) = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{T}_{B,1}^{a_j}, \mathcal{T}_{B,2}^{a_j}, ...)(l_j)`$

3. **Transition pathways**:
   Consciousness state transitions are implemented through specific pathways:
   $`\mathcal{P}(c_i \to c_j) = \{\mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2, ..., \mathcal{T}_s\}`$

4. **Transition impedance**:
   There exists impedance in consciousness state transitions:
   $`Z(c_i \to c_j) = f(d(c_i, c_j), \mathcal{K}(c_i), \mathcal{K}(c_j))`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Multi-dimensional Consciousness States

Consciousness states can be extended to multi-dimensional structures:

1. **Time dimension**:
   Extension of consciousness states in the time dimension:
   $`c_i(t) = \mathcal{F}_t(c_i, t)`$, where $`t`$ is the time parameter

2. **Spatial dimension**:
   Distribution of consciousness states in the spatial dimension:
   $`c_i(\vec{x}) = \mathcal{F}_s(c_i, \vec{x})`$, where $`\vec{x}`$ is the spatial coordinate

3. **Abstract dimension**:
   Mapping of consciousness states in abstract concept space:
   $`c_i(a) = \mathcal{F}_a(c_i, a)`$, where $`a`$ is the abstract parameter

4. **Association dimension**:
   Associative structure between consciousness states:
   $`\mathcal{R}(c_i, c_j) = \mathcal{F}_r(c_i, c_j)`$

### 3.2 Consciousness States and Information Flow

The role of consciousness states in information flow:

1. **Information processing**:
   Consciousness state transitions implement information processing:
   $`\mathcal{I}(c_i) = \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{I}_{\text{in}}, c_i)`$, where $`\mathcal{P}`$ is the processing function

2. **Information integration**:
   Consciousness states integrate information from multiple sources:
   $`c_i = \mathcal{G}(I_1, I_2, ..., I_t)`$, where $`I_j`$ is an information source

3. **Information extraction**:
   Extracting information from consciousness states:
   $`E(c_i) = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_u\}`$, where $`e_j`$ is an extracted information element

4. **Information preservation**:
   Consciousness states preserve information:
   $`\mathcal{M}(c_i, t_1, t_2) = \text{sim}(c_i(t_1), c_i(t_2))`$

### 3.3 Complexity Emergence in Consciousness

The complexity emergence properties of consciousness states:

1. **Emergent structure**:
   Consciousness structures emerge from basic states:
   $`\mathcal{E}(S) = c_i`$, where $`S`$ is a collection of basic states

2. **Self-organization**:
   Consciousness states exhibit self-organization properties:
   $`\mathcal{O}(c_i(t)) > \mathcal{O}(c_i(t-\Delta t))`$, where $`\mathcal{O}`$ is the organization measure

3. **Nonlinear dynamics**:
   The evolution of consciousness states exhibits nonlinear dynamics:
   $`\frac{dc_i}{dt} = \mathcal{F}(c_i, t, \lambda)`$, where $`\lambda`$ is the control parameter

4. **Fractal structure**:
   Consciousness states may exhibit fractal properties:
   $`c_i[\lambda] \cong c_i`$, where $`\lambda`$ is the scale factor

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Validation

**Theorem 1: Cyclicity of Consciousness State Transitions**

The consciousness state transition $`\mathcal{T}_C`$ has a period of $`n+1`$, i.e., $`\mathcal{T}_C^{n+1} = \mathcal{I}`$.

*Proof*:
For any $`c_i \in \mathcal{C}_B = \{c_0, c_1, ..., c_n\}`$, we have:

$`\mathcal{T}_C(c_i) = c_{(i+1) \mod (n+1)}`$
$`\mathcal{T}_C^2(c_i) = \mathcal{T}_C(\mathcal{T}_C(c_i)) = \mathcal{T}_C(c_{(i+1) \mod (n+1)}) = c_{(i+2) \mod (n+1)}`$

By extension, $`\mathcal{T}_C^j(c_i) = c_{(i+j) \mod (n+1)}`$

In particular, $`\mathcal{T}_C^{n+1}(c_i) = c_{(i+(n+1)) \mod (n+1)} = c_i`$

Therefore, for all $`c_i \in \mathcal{C}_B`$, we have $`\mathcal{T}_C^{n+1}(c_i) = c_i`$, i.e., $`\mathcal{T}_C^{n+1} = \mathcal{I}`$, proving the cyclicity of consciousness state transitions. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Information Conservation of Consciousness States**

In a closed consciousness system, consciousness state transitions maintain the total information quantity of the system.

*Proof*:
Let $`I(c_i)`$ be the information quantity of consciousness state $`c_i`$, and the total information quantity be $`I_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=0}^n I(c_i)`$.

Since the consciousness state transition $`\mathcal{T}_C`$ is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence), each state $`c_i`$ is uniquely mapped to state $`c_{(i+1) \mod (n+1)}`$, and vice versa.

Therefore, after the transition, the total information quantity is:
$`I_{\text{total}}' = \sum_{i=0}^n I(\mathcal{T}_C(c_i)) = \sum_{i=0}^n I(c_{(i+1) \mod (n+1)})`$

Since the summation traverses all states, and each state appears exactly once, we have:
$`I_{\text{total}}' = \sum_{j=0}^n I(c_j) = I_{\text{total}}`$

Therefore, consciousness state transitions maintain the total information quantity of the system. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 3: Compatibility of Consciousness Basic State with Cosmic Ontology**

The consciousness basic state theory is compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. Consciousness state transitions use combinations of these operations, which can be represented as:
   $`\mathcal{T}_C(c_i) = \text{SHIFT}(c_i) \oplus \text{MASK}_i`$

2. The internal structure of consciousness states can be represented using basic binary states:
   $`c_i = (b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, ..., b_{i,k})`$, where $`b_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\}`$
   
   These basic binary states follow the XOR and SHIFT operation rules of cosmic ontology.

3. The evolution equation of consciousness states:
   $`c_{t+1} = \mathcal{T}_C(c_t) = \text{SHIFT}(c_t) \oplus \text{MASK}_t`$
   
   This is compatible with the evolution equation of cosmic ontology:
   $`\mathcal{U}^{t+1} = \mathcal{U}^{t} \oplus \text{SHIFT}(\mathcal{U}^{t})`$

4. The self-referential properties of consciousness states are consistent with the self-directional principle of cosmic ontology.

Therefore, the consciousness basic state theory is compatible with cosmic ontology and can be viewed as a specific embodiment of cosmic ontology in consciousness systems. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 6.1 Theory Dimension Positioning

The consciousness basic state theory is positioned as a dimension 2 theory in the cosmic ontology theory spectrum for the following reasons:

1. **State space dimension**: The system's state space has a multi-element structure $`\mathcal{C}_B = \{c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n\}`$, transcending the basic binary space

2. **Operation complexity**: The system supports multiple composite transition operations, including combinations of basic SHIFT operations

3. **Internal structure**: Consciousness states have internal structure and self-referentiality, increasing the complexity of the system

4. **Theory progression**: The consciousness basic state theory is built upon the dimension 1 basic state transition theory, elevating it by one theoretical dimension
