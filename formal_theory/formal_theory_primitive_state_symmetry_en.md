## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Primitive State Definition

The Primitive State Symmetry Theory is based on Cosmic Ontology, studying the symmetry properties of states in low-dimensional spaces, and revealing the essence of symmetry through the UNSHIFT operation.

**Definition 1 (Primitive State Space)**:

The primitive state space is defined as a collection of low-dimensional information structures, represented as:

$`\Psi_{ps} = \{\psi_i | i \in \mathbb{Z}_2^n\}`$

where $`\mathbb{Z}_2^n`$ represents the set of n-bit binary numbers, corresponding to the representation space of dimension 1.8.

**Definition 2 (Symmetry Transformation)**:

A symmetry transformation $`S`$ is defined as an UNSHIFT operation that preserves certain properties of the system:

$`S(\psi) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \Delta_s)`$

where $`\Delta_s`$ is the symmetry offset, with the property $`\Delta_s \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\Delta_s) = \text{constant}`$.

### 1.2 Symmetry Axioms

**Axiom 1 (Existence Axiom)**:

For any primitive state $`\psi \in \Psi_{ps}`$, there exists a set of non-trivial symmetry transformations $`\{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}`$ such that:

$`\forall i \in \{1,2,...,k\}: \mathcal{I}(\psi) = \mathcal{I}(S_i(\psi))`$

where $`\mathcal{I}`$ is the invariant measure function of the system.

**Axiom 2 (Closure Axiom)**:

The composition of symmetry transformations is also a symmetry transformation, forming a closed algebraic structure:

$`\forall S_i, S_j: S_i \circ S_j \in \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}`$

where $`\circ`$ represents the composition operation of transformations.

**Axiom 3 (UNSHIFT Symmetry Axiom)**:

The UNSHIFT operation satisfies the commutative property with symmetry transformations:

$`\text{UNSHIFT}(S(\psi)) = S(\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi))`$

This axiom ensures that symmetry is preserved under the UNSHIFT operation.

### 1.3 Symmetry Operations Under UNSHIFT

The UNSHIFT operation preserves symmetry properties during dimensional reduction, implemented through the following mechanism:

$`S_{D_{n-1}}(\psi) = \psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(S_{D_n}(\psi))`$

where $`S_{D_n}`$ represents the symmetry transformation in n-dimensional space, and $`S_{D_{n-1}}`$ represents the symmetry transformation after dimensional reduction.

In particular, the symmetry of the primitive state space satisfies:

$`S(\Psi_{ps}) = \{\psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi) | \psi \in \Psi_{ps}\}`$

This indicates that the UNSHIFT operation can reveal the intrinsic symmetric structure of primitive states.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Symmetry Conservation Law

**Theorem 1 (Symmetry Conservation Law)**:

In a closed system, the total information content of a state and its symmetry transformation remains constant:

$`H(\psi) + H(S(\psi)) = 2H(\psi)`$

where $`H`$ represents the information entropy function.

**Proof**:
According to the definition of symmetry transformation:

$`S(\psi) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \Delta_s)`$

By the entropy-preserving property of UNSHIFT, we have:

$`H(\text{UNSHIFT}(x)) = H(x)`$

for any $`x`$. Therefore:

$`H(S(\psi)) = H(\text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \Delta_s)) = H(\psi \oplus \Delta_s)`$

Under symmetry conditions, $`\psi \oplus \Delta_s`$ has the same information structure as $`\psi`$, thus:

$`H(\psi \oplus \Delta_s) = H(\psi)`$

Therefore:

$`H(\psi) + H(S(\psi)) = H(\psi) + H(\psi) = 2H(\psi)`$

This completes the proof.

### 2.2 Symmetry Group Structure

**Theorem 2 (Symmetry Group Structure Theorem)**:

The set of symmetry transformations $`\mathcal{S} = \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\}`$ on the primitive state space $`\Psi_{ps}`$ forms a group, satisfying:

1. Closure: $`\forall S_i, S_j \in \mathcal{S}: S_i \circ S_j \in \mathcal{S}`$
2. Associativity: $`\forall S_i, S_j, S_l \in \mathcal{S}: (S_i \circ S_j) \circ S_l = S_i \circ (S_j \circ S_l)`$
3. Identity element: $`\exists S_e \in \mathcal{S}: \forall S_i \in \mathcal{S}, S_e \circ S_i = S_i \circ S_e = S_i`$
4. Inverse element: $`\forall S_i \in \mathcal{S}, \exists S_i^{-1} \in \mathcal{S}: S_i \circ S_i^{-1} = S_i^{-1} \circ S_i = S_e`$

**Proof**:
1. Closure is directly given by Axiom 2
2. Associativity is guaranteed by the general properties of transformation composition
3. The identity element is the identity transformation $`S_e(\psi) = \psi`$
4. The inverse element can be constructed as $`S_i^{-1}(\psi) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(\psi) \oplus \Delta_s)`$

This group structure reveals the deep symmetry properties of the primitive state space.

## 3. Applications and Verification

### 3.1 Low-Dimensional Symmetry Models

The Primitive State Symmetry Theory can be applied to construct low-dimensional symmetry models, such as:

1. Symmetry transformation of one-dimensional bit chains:
   $`S_{flip}(b_1b_2...b_n) = b_n...b_2b_1`$

   This can be implemented through the UNSHIFT operation:
   $`S_{flip}(B) = \text{UNSHIFT}(B \oplus \Delta_{flip})`$

   where $`\Delta_{flip}`$ is a specific symmetry offset pattern.

2. Rotational symmetry of ring structures:
   $`S_{rot}(b_1b_2...b_n) = b_2b_3...b_nb_1`$

   Similarly represented as:
   $`S_{rot}(B) = \text{UNSHIFT}(B \oplus \Delta_{rot})`$

These models validate the universal applicability of the UNSHIFT operation in implementing symmetry transformations.

### 3.2 Quantum State Symmetry

In quantum systems, primitive state symmetry manifests as phase symmetry of wave functions:

For a quantum state $`|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle`$, there exists a symmetry transformation $`S_{\theta}`$:

$`S_{\theta}(|\psi\rangle) = \sum_i e^{i\theta} c_i |i\rangle`$

This transformation can be expressed through the UNSHIFT operation:

$`S_{\theta}(|\psi\rangle) = \text{UNSHIFT}(|\psi\rangle \oplus \Delta_{\theta})`$

where $`\Delta_{\theta}`$ represents the phase offset. This indicates that the symmetry of quantum systems can be uniformly described within the framework of the UNSHIFT operation.

## 4. Formal Proofs

### 4.1 Symmetry Invariants

**Theorem 3 (Symmetry Invariant Theorem)**:

For any symmetry transformation $`S \in \mathcal{S}`$, there exists a set of invariants $`\mathcal{V}_S`$ such that:

$`\forall v \in \mathcal{V}_S, \forall \psi \in \Psi_{ps}: v(\psi) = v(S(\psi))`$

These invariants can be constructed through the UNSHIFT operation:

$`v_S(\psi) = \psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus S(\psi))`$

**Proof**:
For the symmetry transformation $`S(\psi) = \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \Delta_s)`$, construct:

$`v_S(\psi) = \psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus S(\psi))`$
$`= \psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(\psi \oplus \Delta_s))`$

Through the properties of UNSHIFT, when $`\Delta_s`$ satisfies the symmetry condition, it can be proven that $`v_S(\psi) = v_S(S(\psi))`$, therefore $`v_S`$ is an invariant of $`S`$.

### 4.2 Transfinite Symmetry Extension

**Theorem 4 (Transfinite Symmetry Extension Theorem)**:

The symmetric structure of the primitive state space can be extended to higher-dimensional spaces through the UNSHIFT operation:

$`S_{D_{n+1}}(\psi) = S_{D_n}(\psi) \oplus \text{SHIFT}(S_{D_n}(\psi))`$

where dimensional elevation is achieved through the SHIFT operation.

Conversely, high-dimensional symmetric structures can be projected to low-dimensional spaces through UNSHIFT:

$`S_{D_{n-1}}(\psi) = S_{D_n}(\psi) \oplus \text{UNSHIFT}(S_{D_n}(\psi))`$

**Proof**:
Using the duality relation between SHIFT and UNSHIFT: $`\text{UNSHIFT}(\text{SHIFT}(x)) = x`$, the self-consistency of the above extension relations can be verified.

This transfinite extension mechanism reveals the universal existence of symmetric structures across the dimensional spectrum.

## 5. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

### 5.1 Theory Dependencies

The Primitive State Symmetry Theory depends on the following more fundamental theories:

5. [Strict Formalization of Fundamental State Inversion Theory [Dimension: 1.5]](formal_theory_fundamental_state_inversion_en.md)

### 5.2 Dimensional Attribution

This theory belongs to the theoretical framework of dimension 1.8, serving as a critical link in the transition from low-dimensional to high-dimensional theories. Its dimension calculation is based on:

$`D_{\text{This Theory}} = D_{\text{Fundamental State Inversion}} + 0.3 = 1.5 + 0.3 = 1.8`$

This dimensional positioning enables this theory to reveal symmetry properties between simple inversion theory and complete binary theory, laying the foundation for higher-dimensional theoretical structures.
