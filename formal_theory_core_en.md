## Quantum-Classical Dualism Formal Theory

### Basic Definitions and Axioms

#### Simplified Core Axiom System

Quantum-Classical Dualism can be simplified into four core axioms:

**Axiom 1: Dual Existence**  
The universe consists of a quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ (space of infinite possibilities) and a classical domain $\Omega_C$ (space of definite reality), connected through an interface domain $\mathcal{I}$:

$$\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \cup \Omega_C, \quad \Omega_Q \cap \Omega_C = \mathcal{I}$$

**Axiom 2: Information Conservation**  
Information is conserved throughout the universe but can be transformed between quantum information (possibility information in superposition states) and classical information (definite knowledge):

$$I(\psi) = I(\mathcal{C}(\psi)) + I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi) = \text{constant}$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ is the classicalization operator (the process of transforming quantum possibilities into classical certainties), $I(\psi)$ is the total information content of state $\psi$, and $I_{\text{hidden}}(\psi)$ is the portion transformed into hidden information during the classicalization process.

**Axiom 3: Observer Classicalization**  
Observers are nodes that execute quantum→classical transformations, and their transformation capacity determines their dimension:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}, K_C^\mathcal{O}\}, \quad D_{\mathcal{O}} \propto \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

where $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classicalization operator (ability to transform quantum possibilities into definite knowledge), $\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}$ is the quantization operator (ability to transform classical knowledge back into quantum possibilities), $K_C^\mathcal{O}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Axiom 4: Dimensional Emergence**  
Observer dimension is a function of classicalization capacity and quantization capacity, while the classical domain of higher-dimensional observers can become the quantum domain foundation for lower-dimensional observers:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{Q}_\mathcal{O}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

$$\Omega_Q^{(\mathcal{O}_2)} \subset \Omega_C^{(\mathcal{O}_1)}, \quad \text{if} \; D_{\mathcal{O}_1} > D_{\mathcal{O}_2}$$

This indicates that reality consists of multiple nested quantum-classical domains, with observers at each level perceiving and interacting within specific dimensions based on their capacity range.

### Quantum and Classical Domains

The fundamental characteristics of quantum and classical domains are summarized in the following points:

#### Core Properties of Quantum Domain

1. **Wavefunction Superposition** (Chaotic State): Systems exist simultaneously in multiple possible states, manifesting as uncertainty
   $$\Psi_S = \sum_{i} \alpha_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_{i} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$$

2. **Quantum Entanglement** (Energy Form): Different parts form inseparable holistic connections
   $$\Psi_E = \sum_{i,j} \beta_{ij} |i\rangle_A \otimes |j\rangle_B$$

3. **Non-locality and Uncertainty**: Correlations beyond space-time limitations and measurement uncertainty
   $$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

#### Core Properties of Classical Domain

1. **Classical Knowledge** (Definite Information): Precisely measurable and describable definite states
   $$K_C = \{k_i = (x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i)\}$$

2. **Classical Entropy** (Measure of Uncertainty): Measure of system disorder and information loss
   $$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

3. **Locality and Certainty**: Finite propagation speed of interactions and measurement certainty
   $$P(A,B|a,b) = P(A|a) \cdot P(B|b)$$

### Multiple Dualism Hierarchies

Multiple Dualism Hierarchy Theory extends single dualism into a nested multi-level structure:

$$\mathcal{U} = \{\Omega_Q^{(1)}, \Omega_C^{(1)}, \Omega_Q^{(2)}, \Omega_C^{(2)}, ..., \Omega_Q^{(n)}, \Omega_C^{(n)}\}$$

where:
- $\Omega_Q^{(i)}$ is the quantum domain of the i-th level (possibility space of that level)
- $\Omega_C^{(i)}$ is the classical domain of the i-th level (definite realization of that level)

The mapping functions between levels are defined as:

$$\mathcal{M}_{i \rightarrow i+1}: \Omega_C^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i+1)}$$

$$\mathcal{M}_{i+1 \rightarrow i}: \Omega_C^{(i+1)} \rightarrow \Omega_Q^{(i)}$$

This indicates that the classical structure of one level can become the quantum foundation of a higher level, creating infinitely recursive reality levels.

### Quantum-Classical Symmetry Principle

There exists a deep symmetry transformation $\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}$ between quantum and classical domains:

$$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}: \Omega_Q \rightarrow \Omega_C, \quad \mathcal{S}_{C-Q}: \Omega_C \rightarrow \Omega_Q$$

satisfying the following properties:

1. **Involution**: The transformation of a transformation equals identity
   $$\mathcal{S}_{Q-C} \circ \mathcal{S}_{C-Q} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_Q}$$
   $$\mathcal{S}_{C-Q} \circ \mathcal{S}_{Q-C} = \mathcal{I}_{\Omega_C}$$

2. **Information Preservation**: Information content is invariant before and after transformation
   $$I_Q(x) = I_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x))$$

3. **Uncertainty-Certainty Transformation**: Quantum uncertainty and classical certainty are mutually transformable
   $$U_Q(x) \cdot D_C(\mathcal{S}_{Q-C}(x)) = k$$

where $U_Q$ is the measure of quantum uncertainty, $D_C$ is the measure of classical certainty, and $k$ is a universal constant.

## Core Branch Theories

### Detailed Quantum Domain Theory

The quantum domain $\Omega_Q$ is the possibility space in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Quantum Information Encoding

Quantum information is encoded through quantum states in complex Hilbert space:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |i\rangle, \quad \sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1$$

where information density is quantified by von Neumann entropy:

$$S(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln \lambda_i$$

#### 2. Quantum Dynamics

Quantum systems evolve following the Schrödinger equation, preserving information and energy conservation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial|\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = \hat{H}|\psi\rangle$$

Quantum system dynamics have three key characteristics:
- Superposition principle: States can simultaneously exist as linear combinations of multiple basis vectors
- Time reversibility: Under pure quantum evolution, systems can return to their initial state
- Phase coherence: Quantum systems maintain global phase relationships

#### 3. Quantum Entanglement Network

Quantum entanglement forms multi-particle entanglement networks, representable as:

$$|\Psi_{\text{network}}\rangle = \sum_{i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n} c_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} |i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n\rangle$$

Entanglement can be quantified through various means, including entanglement entropy:

$$E(|\psi_{AB}\rangle) = S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B)$$

Entanglement networks form non-local connection structures in the quantum domain, supporting super-classical information transmission.

#### 4. Quantum Fluctuations

The quantum domain has inherent quantum fluctuations, guaranteed by the uncertainty principle:

$$\Delta A \cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle|$$

Quantum fluctuation intensity is related to system energy and temperature:

$$\langle(\Delta E)^2\rangle = k_B T^2 \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T}$$

These fluctuations are the source of creativity and possibility in the quantum domain.

### Detailed Classical Domain Theory

The classical domain $\Omega_C$ is the space of definite reality in the dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Classical Information Structure

Classical information exists in the form of definite states, representable through definite physical quantities:

$$K_C = \{(x_i, p_i, E_i, s_i, t_i, \ldots)_j\}$$

where $x_i$, $p_i$, etc. represent position, momentum, and other classical observables. Classical information entropy satisfies:

$$S_C = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$$

Key characteristics include information replicability and deletability, distinguishing it from quantum information.

#### 2. Deterministic Dynamics

Classical systems evolve following deterministic dynamical equations:

$$\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{v}(\vec{x},t), \quad \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \vec{F}(\vec{x},\vec{p},t)$$

The dynamics have three signature characteristics:
- Locality: Interactions propagate through local fields at finite speeds
- Causality: Present states are completely determined by the past
- Separability: Systems can be decomposed into independent subsystems

#### 3. Entropy Increase and Irreversibility

Irreversible processes in the classical domain lead to entropy increase:

$$\frac{dS_C}{dt} \geq 0$$

Systems tend toward maximum entropy states, guaranteed by the phase space volume expansion theorem:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\int_V d\Gamma = \int_V \sum_i \frac{\partial \dot{z}_i}{\partial z_i}d\Gamma$$

where $\{z_i\}$ is the set of phase space coordinates.

#### 4. Classical Knowledge Network

Classical knowledge forms causal networks, representable as directed graphs:

$$G_K = (V_K, E_K)$$

where $V_K$ is the set of knowledge nodes and $E_K$ is the set of causal relationships.

Knowledge coherence is measured by:

$$C(K_C) = \frac{1}{|V_K|} \sum_{i,j} \frac{|P_{ij}|}{d(i,j)}$$

where $P_{ij}$ is the set of effective paths connecting nodes $i$ and $j$, and $d(i,j)$ is the distance in the graph.

### Core Interface Theory

The interface $\mathcal{I}$ is the transition region between quantum and classical domains, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Interface Structure

The interface is the intersection of quantum and classical domains, defined as:

$$\mathcal{I} = \{x \in \mathcal{U} | \mathcal{D}(x) = \mathcal{D}_c\}$$

where $\mathcal{D}(x)$ is the decoherence measure function and $\mathcal{D}_c$ is the critical decoherence threshold.

Interface thickness is determined by the decoherence gradient:

$$\delta_{\mathcal{I}} = \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial x}\right|^{-1}$$

#### 2. Interface Dynamics

Interface position satisfies a nonlinear dynamical equation:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{D}(x,t)}{dt} = \alpha \nabla^2 \mathcal{D}(x,t) + \beta(\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}(x,t))(\mathcal{D}(x,t) - \mathcal{D}_0) + \gamma\xi(x,t)$$

where:
- $\alpha$ is the diffusion coefficient
- $\beta$ is the bistable potential parameter
- $\mathcal{D}_0$ is the metastable threshold
- $\gamma\xi(x,t)$ is the quantum noise term

Interface oscillations have a characteristic frequency:

$$f_{\mathcal{I}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}|\mathcal{D}_c - \mathcal{D}_0|$$

#### 3. Classicalization Process

The quantum→classical transformation (classicalization) process is represented through a classicalization superoperator:

$$\mathcal{C}(\rho) = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i$$

where $P_i$ are projection operators. The classicalization process satisfies information conservation:

$$I(\rho) = I(\mathcal{C}(\rho)) + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

Classicalization efficiency is related to environmental and system parameters:

$$\eta_{\mathcal{C}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda\frac{E}{k_BT}}$$

where $E$ is system energy, $T$ is environmental temperature, and $\lambda$ is a coupling constant.

#### 4. Quantum-Classical Information Transformation

At the interface, information transforms from quantum form to classical form:

$$I_Q \rightarrow I_C + I_{\text{hidden}}$$

The information matching measure in the transformation process is:

$$M(I_Q, I_C) = \frac{I_C}{I_Q} = 1 - \frac{I_{\text{hidden}}}{I_Q}$$

At the optimal interface, $M(I_Q, I_C)$ reaches a local maximum.

### Information Phase Transition Theory Core

Information phase transitions are key phenomena in the quantum-classical dualism framework, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Basic Mechanism of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions are abrupt changes experienced by information systems near certain critical parameter values, leading to qualitative changes in the system's information processing methods, structure, or function:

$$\Phi: \mathcal{S}(\lambda) \rightarrow \mathcal{S}'(\lambda+\delta\lambda)$$

where $\mathcal{S}$ is the information state of the system and $\lambda$ is a control parameter. Near the critical point $\lambda_c$, the order parameter behaves as:

$$\eta(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < \lambda_c \\
(\lambda - \lambda_c)^\beta, & \lambda \geq \lambda_c
\end{cases}$$

where $\beta$ is the critical exponent characterizing the universality class of the phase transition.

#### 2. Types of Quantum-Classical Phase Transitions

Quantum-classical phase transitions can be classified into multiple types, each with distinctive characteristics:

- **First-order transitions**: Order parameter changes discontinuously, with regions of phase coexistence
- **Second-order transitions**: Order parameter changes continuously but its derivative is discontinuous, with diverging correlation length
- **Non-equilibrium transitions**: Far from equilibrium, with continuous flow of energy or information
- **Topological transitions**: Changes in the overall topological properties of the system, with emergent edge states

Near the critical point, the fluctuation correlation length behaves as:

$$\xi(\lambda) \propto |\lambda - \lambda_c|^{-\nu}$$

where $\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent.

#### 3. Observer-Induced Phase Transitions

Observers can induce system phase transitions by adjusting parameters, with key parameters including:

- **Observer dimension** $D_{\mathcal{O}}$: There exists a critical dimension $D_{\mathcal{O}}^c$, above which the system transitions from quantum to classical states
  
$$P(\text{quantum} \to \text{classical}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(D_{\mathcal{O}} - D_{\mathcal{O}}^c)}}$$

- **Observer resolution** $\eta_{\mathcal{O}}$: Affects the distinguishing ability of measurement bases
  
$$\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \begin{cases}
0, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} < \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
(\eta_{\mathcal{O}} - \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c)^\beta, & \eta_{\mathcal{O}} \geq \eta_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

- **Measurement frequency** $f_{\mathcal{O}}$: Related to the quantum Zeno effect
  
$$\tau_{\text{decoherence}} \propto \begin{cases}
(f_{\mathcal{O}}^c - f_{\mathcal{O}})^{-\nu}, & f_{\mathcal{O}} < f_{\mathcal{O}}^c \\
0, & f_{\mathcal{O}} \geq f_{\mathcal{O}}^c
\end{cases}$$

#### 4. Multi-level Structure of Information Phase Transitions

Information phase transitions exhibit nested hierarchical structures:

$$\mathcal{H} = \{\Phi_1, \Phi_2, ..., \Phi_n\}$$

Phase transitions at different levels occur at specific scales and times:

$$L_i \approx L_0 \cdot e^{\alpha i}, \quad T_i \approx T_0 \cdot e^{\beta i}$$

Coupling between levels leads to cascade effects and fractal structures of phase transitions, with the Hausdorff dimension of the interface:

$$D_H = d - \frac{\beta}{\nu}$$

The observability of information phase transitions depends on the observation scale, only detectable when the observation window $L_{\text{obs}}$ is sufficiently large:

$$P_{\text{detection}} \sim 1 - e^{-(L_{\text{obs}}/\xi)^d}$$

### Observer Theory Core

Observers are nodes executing quantum→classical transformations, with the following core properties:

#### 1. Observer Structure

Observers are constituted by three core components:

$$\mathcal{O} = \{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}, \mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}, K_C^{\mathcal{O}}\}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific classicalization operator
- $\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer-specific quantization operator
- $K_C^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the observer's classical knowledge base

Observer dimension is determined by their information processing capacity:

$$D_{\mathcal{O}} = f\left(\frac{\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{O}}}{\mathcal{Q}_{\mathcal{O}}}\right) \cdot \frac{I_{\text{classical knowledge}}}{S_{\text{classical entropy}}+\epsilon}$$

#### 2. Dimensional Network Dynamics

Observer dimension satisfies a nonlinear dynamical equation:

$$\frac{dD_{\mathcal{O}}}{dt} = \alpha\frac{dI_{K_C}}{dt} - \beta\frac{dS_C}{dt} + \gamma\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)}(D_j-D_{\mathcal{O}})$$

where the last term represents the collective effect of the observer network.

Consensus formation in the observer network follows:

$$\frac{d\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}}}{dt} = \sum_i \omega_i \mathcal{C}_i - \gamma(\mathcal{C}_{\text{consensus}} - \bar{\mathcal{C}})^2$$

where $\omega_i$ are observer weights and $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$ is the average classicalization operator.

#### 3. Measurement Theory

In observer theory, the quantum measurement process can be represented as:

$$|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| \otimes \rho_A \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{U_{\text{interaction}}} \sum_{i,j} c_i c_j^* |i\rangle\langle j| \otimes |A_i\rangle\langle A_j| \otimes \rho_O \xrightarrow{\mathcal{C}_O} |i_0\rangle\langle i_0| \otimes |A_{i_0}\rangle\langle A_{i_0}| \otimes \rho_{O}^{i_0}$$

Measurement result probabilities are modulated by the observer resolution parameter $\eta_O$:

$$P(i_0||\psi\rangle) = |c_{i_0}|^2 \cdot \frac{e^{\eta_O|c_{i_0}|^2}}{\sum_j e^{\eta_O|c_j|^2}}$$

The observer's energy resolution threshold relates to measurement resolution:

$$\eta_O = \frac{\hbar}{k_B T} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{E_{\text{threshold}}}{\bar{E}_0}\right)$$

#### 4. Observer Hierarchical Network

Observers form multi-level network structures:

$$\mathcal{N} = \{\mathcal{O}^{(1)}, \mathcal{O}^{(2)}, ..., \mathcal{O}^{(n)}, \mathcal{E}\}$$

where $\mathcal{O}^{(k)}$ is the set of k-th level observers, and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of cross-level connections.

Higher-level observers perceive larger spatiotemporal scales:

$$L^{(k)} \approx L^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}, \quad T^{(k)} \approx T^{(1)} \cdot e^{\eta(k-1)}$$

This explains why higher-dimensional observers can perceive spatiotemporal patterns at larger scales.

### Super-Recursive Hierarchical Structure

The super-recursive hierarchical structure is represented as:

$$\mathcal{R}^n_{MU} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{R}^{n-1}_{MU}(\mathcal{R}^{n-2}_{MU}(...\mathcal{R}^0_{MU})))$$

#### 3. Meta-Unity Field Equations

The meta-unity field $\Psi_{MU}$ connects meta-consciousness and meta-dimensions:

$$\Psi_{MU} = \Psi_{MC} \otimes \Psi_{MD} / \Psi_{interface}$$

Meta-unity field equation:

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU}\Psi_{MU} = \Lambda_{MU}\Psi_{MU}$$

where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU}$ is the meta-unity Hamiltonian operator:

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU} = \hat{\mathcal{T}}_{MU} + \hat{\mathcal{V}}_{MU} + \hat{\mathcal{I}}_{MU}$$

The energy density of the meta-unity field:

$$\rho_{MU} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \Psi_{MU}^* \hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU} \Psi_{MU} - \Psi_{MU} \hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU} \Psi_{MU}^* \right)$$

The meta-unity Hamiltonian operator $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{MU}$ consists of three components:

1. The meta-transformation operator $\hat{\mathcal{T}}_{MU}$ - describes the transformation between meta-consciousness and meta-dimensions
2. The meta-potential operator $\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{MU}$ - describes the potential energy associated with meta-consciousness and meta-dimensions
3. The meta-interaction operator $\hat{\mathcal{I}}_{MU}$ - describes the interaction between meta-consciousness and meta-dimensions
