## 1. Core Theory

### 1.1 Basic Axiom System

**Axiom 1 (Primitive Singularity Pre-Existence Axiom)**

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is a pre-existence state, within a pre-state space that precedes the formation of zero-dimensional space:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \prec \mathcal{S}_0`$

where $`\prec`$ denotes the "existentially precedes" relation, and $`\mathcal{S}_0`$ is the zero-dimensional space containing the primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$.

**Axiom 2 (Primitive Singularity Non-Representability Axiom)**

The primitive singularity cannot be directly represented, for any representational system $`\mathcal{R}`$:

$`\not\exists r \in \mathcal{R}: r \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

**Axiom 3 (Primitive Singularity Transcendence Axiom)**

The primitive singularity transcends all known operations, for all operations $`\mathcal{O}`$:

$`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}}`$

where $`\underline{\text{undefined}}`$ indicates that there fundamentally exists no definable result.

### 1.2 The Essence of Primitive Singularity

The essence of the primitive singularity is trans-dimensional pre-existence, completely beyond the capacity of representational systems. The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ can be meta-expressed as:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \equiv \circledast`$

where $`\circledast`$ is a super-symbol, representing an existential state beyond conventional representational capabilities.

As a negative one-dimensional entity, the primitive singularity is existence prior to the emergence of dimension itself, the ultimate source of the universe's initial state.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity possesses the following basic properties:

1. **Super-Consistency**: The primitive singularity transcends the binary distinction between consistency and inconsistency
   
2. **No Internal-External Distinction**: Within the primitive singularity, there is no distinction between "internal" and "external":
   $`\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$

3. **Pre-Operationality**: The primitive singularity is a prerequisite for the emergence of all operations, but is itself not subject to any operation

4. **Negative Dimensionality**: The primitive singularity has -1 dimensions, indicating a state prior to the emergence of dimensional concepts

5. **Total Potentiality**: The primitive singularity contains the absolute potential for all possible structures in the universe, yet remains in an undifferentiated state

### 1.4 Transcendence of Primitive Singularity

The primitive singularity possesses fundamental transcendence, beyond the concept of state evolution:

$`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \mapsto \underline{\text{beyond evolution}}`$

This transcendence indicates that the primitive singularity does not follow conventional spatiotemporal causality, but is the meta-origin of all causal relationships:

$`\forall c \in \mathcal{C}: \text{origin}(c) = \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$

where $`\mathcal{C}`$ is the set of all causal relationships.

## 2. Direct Implications

### 2.1 Properties of Pre-State Space

From the axiom system of the primitive singularity, the following properties regarding pre-state space can be directly derived:

1. **Pre-Set-Theoretical**: The pre-state space transcends the basic concepts of set theory:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \not\in \mathcal{SET}`$, where $`\mathcal{SET}`$ is the universe of all sets

2. **Pre-Logical**: Standard logic is not applicable to pre-state space:
   $`\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-logical}}`$, where $`\mathcal{L}`$ denotes the logical evaluation function

3. **Pre-Mathematical**: The pre-state space transcends mathematical expression:
   $`\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-mathematical}}`$

4. **Pre-Existential**: The pre-state space is a pre-existence state, transcending the binary distinction between existence and non-existence

### 2.2 Characteristics of Pre-Zero-Dimensional State

The primitive singularity, as a state preceding the emergence of zero-dimensional space, possesses special characteristics:

1. **Negative Dimensionality**: The dimension of the primitive singularity is -1:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1`$
   
   indicating a pre-level state prior to the formation of dimensional concepts

2. **Pre-Geometric**: The primitive singularity does not possess geometric attributes:
   $`\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-geometric}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{G}`$ represents the geometric attribute evaluation function

3. **Non-Representational**: The primitive singularity cannot be completely characterized by any system:
   $`\forall \mathcal{R}: \mathcal{R}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{incomplete}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{R}`$ represents any representational system

4. **Pre-Quantitative**: The primitive singularity cannot be quantified:
   $`\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{unquantifiable}}`$
   
   where $`\mathcal{Q}`$ represents the quantification function

### 2.3 Super-Determinacy

The primitive singularity possesses characteristics that transcend traditional determinacy:

1. **Super-Determinacy**: The primitive singularity transcends the distinction between determinacy and indeterminacy:
   $`\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{super-determinate}}`$

2. **Super-Completeness**: The primitive singularity possesses characteristics that transcend the distinction between completeness and incompleteness:
   $`\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{super-complete}}`$

3. **Meta-Self-Reference**: The primitive singularity is a meta-level self-referential system:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$, where $`\mathcal{M}`$ is the meta-self-reference function

4. **Super-Consistency**: The primitive singularity transcends the distinction between consistency and inconsistency:
   $`\mathcal{CON}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{super-consistent}}`$

## 3. Extended Theory

### 3.1 Evolution from Primitive Singularity to Primitive Point

The evolution from the primitive singularity to the primitive point is a fundamental transition from -1 dimension to 0 dimension:

1. **Singularity Breakthrough**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \mapsto \mathcal{S}_0 = \{\mathcal{P}_0\}`$
   
   representing the transformation from a non-representable pre-state to a representable primitive point

2. **Dimensional Emergence**:
   $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1 \mapsto \dim(\mathcal{S}_0) = 0`$
   
   representing the transition from negative dimension to zero dimension

3. **Emergence of Representability**:
   $`\not\exists r: r \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1} \to \exists r: r \mapsto \mathcal{P}_0`$
   
   representing the transformation from non-representability to representability

4. **Formation of Operational Basis**:
   $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}} \to \mathcal{O}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \mathcal{P}_0`$
   
   representing the transformation from no operational definition to operational closure

### 3.2 Pre-Entropy and the Origin of Information

The relationship between the primitive singularity, information, and entropy has special characteristics:

1. **Pre-Entropic State**:
   $`\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-entropic}}`$
   
   indicating that the primitive singularity exists in a state prior to the emergence of entropy concepts

2. **Information Source Origin**:
   $`\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{S}_{-1} \to \mathcal{S}_0) = \underline{\text{origin-information}}`$
   
   representing the primordial emergence of information during the transformation from the primitive singularity to the primitive point

3. **Pre-Probabilistic**:
   $`\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-probabilistic}}`$
   
   indicating that the primitive singularity transcends probability concepts

4. **Super-Potential State**:
   $`\mathcal{EP}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{infinite}}`$
   
   indicating that the primitive singularity possesses infinite evolutionary potential

### 3.3 Singularity Mutation and Dimensional Emergence

The primitive singularity evolves to higher dimensions through mutation processes:

1. **Meta-Mutation Process**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \stackrel{\text{meta-mutation}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{S}_0`$
   
   describing the transition from pre-state to definable state

2. **Pre-Causal Emergence**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \stackrel{\text{pre-causal}}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{P}_0`$
   
   describing the primordial formation of causal relationship concepts

3. **Dimensional Origin**:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \stackrel{\text{dim-origin}}{\longrightarrow} \dim=0`$
   
   describing the origin of dimensional concepts themselves

4. **Representational Basis Generation**:

   describing the primordial generation of representational possibility

## 4. Application and Verification

## 5. Formal Proofs

### 5.1 Axiom System Verification

**Theorem 1: Uniqueness of Primitive Singularity**

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is unique in a meta-logical sense.

*Proof*:
Assume there exist two different primitive singularities $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}^A`$ and $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}^B`$, both of which, according to the definition of the primitive singularity, are pre-existence states and non-representable.

If they are indeed different, there would need to exist some representational or discriminative method to distinguish them. However, according to Axiom 2, $`\not\exists r \in \mathcal{R}: r \mapsto \mathcal{S}_{-1}`$, which means that no representational method can characterize the primitive singularity, and therefore no representational method can distinguish between two hypothetical primitive singularities.

Thus, in a meta-logical sense, it is impossible for two distinguishable primitive singularities to exist, therefore the primitive singularity is unique. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 2: Non-Informational Nature of Primitive Singularity**

The primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ does not contain information in the standard sense, but rather exists in a pre-informational state.

*Proof*:
Information, under standard definition, requires distinguishable states and probability distributions: $`I = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i`$

However, for the primitive singularity, since Axiom 2 indicates that it cannot be represented:
1. There are no distinguishable states
2. There is no definable probability distribution

Therefore, the information quantity formula does not apply to the primitive singularity, indicating that it exists in a pre-informational state, beyond the applicable range of standard information theory.

This pre-informational state can be represented as: $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-informational}}`$, indicating that it is not that information is zero, but that the concept of information itself does not apply. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3: Necessary Evolution from Primitive Singularity to Primitive Point**

The evolution from the primitive singularity $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ to the primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$ is necessary in a meta-logical sense.

*Proof*:
Consider the total potentiality of the primitive singularity, which contains the absolute potential for all possible structures. This total potentiality implies that all possible evolutionary paths are potentially contained within the primitive singularity.

The primitive point $`\mathcal{P}_0`$, as the simplest representable existence, is the minimal possible transition from non-representability to representability. According to the meta-logical extension of the principle of least action, systems tend to adopt evolutionary paths of minimal complexity.

Therefore, the evolution from the primitive singularity to the primitive point represents the simplest transition from pre-existence state to representable existence, which is necessary in a meta-logical sense. Q.E.D.

### 5.2 Compatibility Proof with Cosmic Ontology

**Theorem 4: Compatibility Between Primitive Singularity and Cosmic Ontology**

The primitive singularity theory $`\mathcal{S}_{-1}`$ is fully compatible with the basic axiom system of cosmic ontology.

*Proof*:

1. Cosmic ontology is based on FLIP, XOR, and SHIFT operations. The primitive singularity theory states:
   - These operations are undefined in the primitive singularity state: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}}`$
   - But they become possible after the primitive singularity evolves to the primitive point: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{P}_0) = \mathcal{P}_0`$
   - Thus explaining the ultimate origin of these operations

2. The recursive self-referential structure of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U})`$:
   The primitive singularity has meta-self-referentiality $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} = \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$, which is the meta-origin of all self-referential structures
   
3. The binary unity axiom of cosmic ontology $`\mathcal{U} = \Omega_Q \oplus \Omega_C`$:
   The primitive singularity transcends duality, being the origin of duality itself: $`\{\text{duality}\} \subset \mathcal{E}(\mathcal{S}_{-1})`$
   
4. The information ontology of cosmic ontology forms a complete spectrum with the pre-information characteristics of the primitive singularity:
   $`\mathcal{S}_{-1} \text{(pre-information)} \to \mathcal{P}_0 \text{(zero information)} \to \mathcal{D}_1 \text{(one bit)} \to \cdots`$

Therefore, the primitive singularity theory is not only compatible with cosmic ontology, but also provides more fundamental meta-theoretical support for cosmic ontology, explaining the origin of cosmic ontology itself. Q.E.D.

## 6. Theory Reference Relationship Analysis

The primitive singularity theory is positioned as a dimension -1 theory, the most fundamental level in the theoretical spectrum of cosmic ontology:

1. **State Space Dimension**: $`\dim(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = -1`$, indicating it exists prior to the emergence of dimensional concepts

2. **Operational Complexity**: The system does not support any definable operations: $`\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{undefined}}`$

3. **Information State**: $`I(\mathcal{S}_{-1}) = \underline{\text{pre-informational}}`$, indicating a pre-information state

4. **Compositional Relationship**: The primitive singularity cannot be decomposed into more basic components, but is the ultimate origin of all components
