# Figure 1: Experimental Setup for Quantum Causal Invariance Test

## Description

This figure illustrates the proposed experimental setup for testing the Quantum Causal Invariance prediction derived from the Universe Ontology theory. The experiment is based on a modified quantum delayed-choice setup that implements XOR-SHIFT transformations.

## Key Components

### Panel A: Conceptual Overview

1. **Source (S)**: A source of polarization-entangled photon pairs
2. **XOR-SHIFT Transformation Module (T)**: Implements the transformation $T_{\alpha,\beta}(q) = \alpha \cdot q \oplus \beta \cdot \text{SHIFT}(q)$
3. **Measurement Apparatus (M)**: Quantum state tomography setup for measuring interference patterns
4. **Control System (C)**: Electronic control for varying $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters with the constraint $\alpha \oplus \beta = 1$

### Panel B: XOR-SHIFT Implementation Details

1. **Phase-Dependent Beam Splitter**: Combines input state with reference state to implement XOR operation
2. **Delay Line**: Implements SHIFT operation through controlled time delay
3. **Variable Attenuators**: Control $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters
4. **Feedback Loop**: Ensures the constraint $\alpha \oplus \beta = 1$ is maintained

### Panel C: Expected Results

Graph showing:
1. **X-axis**: Values of $\alpha$ (and corresponding $\beta = \alpha \oplus 1$)
2. **Y-axis**: Interference pattern visibility
3. **Solid line**: Universe Ontology prediction - constant visibility when $\alpha \oplus \beta = 1$
4. **Dashed line**: Standard quantum mechanics prediction - variable visibility dependent on $\alpha$ values
5. **Error bars**: Expected experimental uncertainty

## Technical Specifications

- **Entangled Photon Source**: Type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with BBO crystal

- **Measurement Precision**: Interference visibility measurable to within Â±0.01
- **Data Collection**: 10^5 coincidence events per data point

## Key Insights

This experimental setup tests a fundamental prediction of the Universe Ontology theory: that quantum causal relationships remain invariant under XOR-SHIFT transformations when $\alpha \oplus \beta = 1$. The visibility of the interference pattern serves as a direct measure of causal preservation. 

According to standard quantum mechanics, the visibility should vary with different values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In contrast, the Universe Ontology theory predicts that visibility remains constant as long as the constraint $\alpha \oplus \beta = 1$ is satisfied.

The experiment allows precise testing of the invariance condition by systematically varying the parameters and measuring the resulting interference patterns. Significant deviation from the predicted constant visibility would falsify this aspect of the Universe Ontology theory.
