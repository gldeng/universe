## What Are the Cosmic Ontology Popular Theories?

Cosmic Ontology is a theoretical system built on two simple operations—XOR and SHIFT—attempting to explain all mysteries of the universe from an information perspective. This collection contains versions written in accessible language, making these profound concepts understandable to ordinary people.

Each article has two types of links:
- **Popular Version**: The simplified version you're reading, explained in everyday language
- **Formal Version**: The professional version containing complete mathematical formulas and rigorous derivations

## Why Use Accessible Language?

The core ideas of Cosmic Ontology are actually quite simple and elegant but are often obscured by professional terminology and mathematical symbols. These popular versions attempt to return to fundamental ideas, making revolutionary concepts accessible to anyone.

A true scientific breakthrough should be able to express its core ideas in simple language—if it can't, it might not be a genuine breakthrough.

## How to Use These Documents

1. **Start with topics that interest you**: Choose the question you're most curious about
2. **Progress step by step**: Begin with lower-dimensional theories, gradually understanding higher dimensions
3. **Cross-reference**: Theories have intrinsic connections and complement each other
4. **Formal reference**: When you need more rigorous proof, check the corresponding formal theory
