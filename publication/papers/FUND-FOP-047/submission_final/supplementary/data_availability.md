# Data Availability Statement

## Computational Resources and Reproducibility

All computational resources used in this research, including simulation code and data processing scripts, are made fully available to ensure reproducibility of our findings. The following resources are provided:

### Source Code

The complete source code for all simulations and analyses presented in this paper is available in the following repository:

- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/loning/universe/tree/cosmos/publication/papers/FUND-FOP-047/simulations
- **License**: MIT License
- **Version**: v38.0 (tagged as "FUND-FOP-047-v38.0")

The source code includes:

1. `constants_relationship_sim.py`: A Python implementation of the XOR-SHIFT operations and collapse breathing proportions calculation
2. `visualization_tools.py`: Utility functions for generating visualizations
3. `precision_analysis.py`: Scripts for high-precision numerical verification of the relationship between constants

### Simulation Results

The raw output data from our simulations, including:

1. High-precision numerical results (to 100 decimal places) for calculated values of the fine structure constant using our theoretical framework
2. Complete time-series data for all simulated collapse-breathing cycles
3. Intermediate values for all XOR and SHIFT operations
4. Error analysis and statistical significance calculations

These data are available as supplementary files in standard formats (CSV, JSON) alongside this publication.

### Computational Environment

To ensure full reproducibility, we provide details of our computational environment:

- **Python version**: 3.9.5
- **Key dependencies**:
  - NumPy 1.20.3
  - SciPy 1.7.1
  - mpmath 1.2.1 (for arbitrary-precision arithmetic)
  - Matplotlib 3.4.3
- **Hardware specifications**: Calculations were performed on a workstation with 64GB RAM and AMD Ryzen 9 5950X processor
- **Environment file**: A conda environment.yml file is provided in the repository to recreate the exact computational environment
