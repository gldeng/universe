The Universe Ontology theory posits that the universe can be described as an information system evolving through two fundamental operations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item XOR ($\oplus$): An operation representing information difference
\item SHIFT ($S$): An operation representing state transition
\end{enumerate}

The core state evolution equation is:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}^{t+1} = \Omega_Q^{t}\oplus\text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{t}\oplus\text{SHIFT}(\Omega_Q^{t}))
\end{equation}

Where $\mathcal{U}$ represents the universe state, $\Omega_Q$ represents the quantum domain, and $t$ is the evolution parameter.

The Quantum XOR Causal Invariance theory extends this framework to quantum systems, defining causal relationships as:

\begin{equation}
C(q_a, q_b) = q_a \oplus \text{SHIFT}(q_b)
\end{equation}

Where $q_a$ and $q_b$ are quantum events, and $C(q_a, q_b)$ represents the causal strength between them.
